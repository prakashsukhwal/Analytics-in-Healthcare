        "text_large = \"\"\" Panax ginseng C.A.Mey . ( Korea red ginseng ) has been used in Asia to treat inflammatory skin diseases . Recently , Korea red ginseng ( KRG means Korea red ginseng ) is emerging as a good candidate for treating atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) because of its anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects . Despite much effort , no systemic prevention strategy has been established for AD means atopic dermatitis currently . Therefore , the aim of this study was to determine the preventive effect of a combination of KRG means Korea red ginseng extract and probiotics on AD-like skin lesions of mice . Forty NC/Nga mice were randomly divided into eight groups : Sham , AD means atopic dermatitis control , Cyclosporine , KRG means Korea red ginseng , Duolac ATP means ATP® ® ( ATP means ATP® ) , BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics Plant Origin Skin Probiotics ( BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics ) , KRG means Korea red ginseng + ATP means ATP® , and KRG means Korea red ginseng + BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics . Mice were administered orally with KRG means Korea red ginseng and/or other agents using a gastric tube for 5 days prior to challenge with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene ( DNCB means days prior to challenge with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene ) . AD-like skin lesions were induced by percutaneous challenge with DNCB means days prior to challenge with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene on ears and backs of NC/Nga mice . Effects of each treatment were evaluated based on the following : Clinical severity score , ear thickness , transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) , total serum Immunoglobulin E ( IgE means Immunoglobulin E ) level , mRNA expression levels and immunohistochemistry analysis of IFN-γ , IL-4 , and TSLP in cutaneous lesions . TEWL means transepidermal water loss , serum IgE means Immunoglobulin E level , and expression of immunohistopathologic markers were more improved in the group using KRG means Korea red ginseng combined with probiotics than in the group using KRG means Korea red ginseng or probiotics alone . ATP means ATP® , KRG means Korea red ginseng + ATP means ATP® , and KRG means Korea red ginseng + BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics groups showed reduced TEWL means transepidermal water loss increase ( ΔTEWL ) at 48 h ( p & lt ; 0.005 ) . KRG means Korea red ginseng + ATP means ATP® showed a preventive effect on the increase of serum IgE means Immunoglobulin E level ( p = 0.009 ) . In immunohistopathologic analysis , KRG means Korea red ginseng , ATP means ATP® , BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics , KRG means Korea red ginseng + ATP means ATP® , and KRG means Korea red ginseng + BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics groups showed significantly reduced expression levels of IFN-γ at 1 h , 6 h , and 48 h ( all p & lt ; 0.05 ) . KRG means Korea red ginseng , ATP means ATP® , BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics , and KRG means Korea red ginseng + BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics groups showed reduced expression levels of IL-4 compared to the AD means atopic dermatitis control group at 6 h and 24 h. KRG means Korea red ginseng , ATP means ATP® , BYO means BYO Plant Origin Skin Probiotics , KRG means Korea red ginseng + ATP means ATP® , and KRG means Korea red ginseng + BYP groups showed significantly lower expression levels of TSLP than the AD means atopic dermatitis control group at 1 h and 24 h. KRG means Korea red ginseng can suppress increases of allergic and inflammatory cytokines and increase of TEWL means transepidermal water loss . A combination of KRG means Korea red ginseng and probiotics might have better effects than KRG means Korea red ginseng or probiotics alone for preventing an AD means atopic dermatitis flare-up .\n",
        "This study aimed to prepare pullulan films containing pomegranate seeds oil ( PSO means pomegranate seeds oil ) based nanocapsules , and evaluate the formulation efficacy in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD)-like lesions induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ( DNCB means 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ) . The Eudragit RS 100 ® nanocapsules ( PSONC ) were prepared by the interfacial precipitation of preformed polymer , whereas the films were produced by the solvent casting method . Pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsions ( PSONE means Pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsions ) were prepared by the spontaneous emulsification method for comparative reasons . Both nanosystems presented adequate mean diameter ( 248±16 nm for PSONE means Pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsions and 181±6 nm for PSONC ) , polydispersity index ( below 0.2 ) , zeta potential ( -25.63±1.1 mV for PSONE means Pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsions and + 43.13±0.7 mV for PSONC ) and pH in the acid range ( 6.77±0.27 and 5.31±0.17 , PSONE means Pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsions and PSONC ) . By a pre-formulations study , sorbitol ( 6.5 % ) and PEG 400 ( 1.5 % ) were considered the most suitable plasticizers for developing pullulan films ( 6 % ) intending topical application . In general , pullulan films were classified as flexible and hydrophilic , with high occlusive properties , 57.6±0.8 % , 64.6±0.8 % for vehicle , PSONCF ( pullulan film containing PSONC ) , respectively . All formulations ( films and nanocarriers ) presented no irritant potential in the chorioallantoic membrane test . In the in vivo model , the treatments with free PSO means pomegranate seeds oil and PSONCF attenuated the skin injury as well as the mechanical hypernociceptive behavioral induced by DNCB means 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene exposure to mice . Importantly , the biochemical analyses provided evidence that only the treatment with PSONCF modulated the inflammatory and the oxidative stress parameters evaluated in this study . In conclusion , these data lead us to believe that PSONC incorporation into a pullulan film matrix improved the biological properties of the PSO means pomegranate seeds oil in this AD-model .\n",
        "Urea is a hygroscopic molecule ( capable of absorbing water ) present in the epidermis as a component of the natural moisturizing factor ( NMF means natural moisturizing factor ) and is essential for the adequate hydration and integrity of the stratum corneum . Urea improves skin barrier function including antimicrobial defense by regulating gene expression in keratinocytes relevant for their differentiation and antimicrobial peptide production . It also plays a fundamental role in regulating keratinocyte proliferation . One of the first uses of urea in modern medicine was the topical treatment of wounds due to its proteolytic and antibacterial properties . At present , urea is widely used in dermatology to improve skin barrier function and as one of the most common moisturizers and keratolytic agents . Urea-containing formulations are available in diverse formulations and concentrations . Multiple clinical trials on the use of urea-containing formulations have shown significant clinical improvement in many of the dermatosis presenting with scaly and dry skin such as atopic dermatitis , ichthyosis , xerosis , seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis , among others . Furthermore , urea can increase skin penetration and optimize the action of topical drugs . Urea-based products are well tolerated ; their side effects are mild and are more frequent at high concentration . Here , we present a review of the use of urea in dermatology , discussing its mechanism of action , safety profile and frequent indications .\n",
        "A decrease in the ceramide content of the stratum corneum is known to cause dry and barrier-disrupted skin . In this literature review , the clinical usefulness of preparations containing natural or synthetic ceramides for water retention and barrier functions was evaluated . The PubMed , Cochrane Library , and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases were searched using keywords such as \" ceramide \" , \" skincare products \" , \" barrier + hydration + moisture + skin \" , and \" randomized trial \" . All database searches were conducted in February 2019 . Forty-one reports were selected based on the following criterion : comparative control studies that evaluated the effects of ceramide-containing formulations based on statistical evidence . Among the 41 reports , 12 were selected using the patient , intervention , comparison , and outcome approach . These 12 reports showed that external ceramide-containing preparations can improve dry skin and barrier function in patients with atopic dermatitis . However , a double-blinded comparative study with a large sample size is warranted for appropriate clinical use .\n",
        "< b > BACKGROUND:</b > Atopic dermatitis is considered a childhood illness , and the direct and indirect health care burden of atopic dermatitis in adults is not fully understood . < b > OBJECTIVE:</b > To measure the direct and indirect costs of atopic dermatitis among adults in 2018 . < b > METHODS:</b > This retrospective cohort study compared commercial and Medicare-insured adults with atopic dermatitis in 2018 with directly matched ( 1:3 ) adults without atopic dermatitis . Atopic dermatitis prevalence was reported . Health care utilization , direct health care costs , and work loss data were compared between cohorts . This analysis was repeated for adults with atopic dermatitis in 2016 and 2017 . < b > RESULTS:</b > 31,164 adults with atopic dermatitis in 2018 were identified and directly matched ( 1:3 ) to controls . Adults with atopic dermatitis had greater utilization of outpatient services , outpatient pharmacy services , and short-term disability benefits than controls . Unadjusted annual health care costs in 2018 were $ 4,979 higher for adults with atopic dermatitis ( $ 14,603 ) than for the matched controls ( $ 9,624 ) , driven by outpatient services and pharmacy . Findings were supported by analyses of adults from 2016 and 2017 and multivariable analyses . One limitation of this study was that patients with mild cases of atopic dermatitis may not seek medical treatment and may be underrepresented in the study cohort . < b > CONCLUSIONS:</b > The direct health care and indirect ( short-term disability ) health care costs of atopic dermatitis present a significant health care burden among the adult population . < b > DISCLOSURES:</b > This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company . Employees of Eli Lilly were involved in the planning , execution , and interpretation of the study . Pierce is employed by Eli Lilly and Company . Boytsov and Goldblum were employed by Eli Lilly and Company Health at the time this research was conducted . Manjelievskaia and Brouillette are employed by IBM Watson Health , which received funding from Eli Lilly and Company to conduct this study .

        "We report a case in which intraocular endoscopy clarified the cause of Ahmed glaucoma valve ( AGV means Ahmed glaucoma valve ) failure with a cloudy cornea . A 42-year-old patient with glaucoma underwent AGV means Ahmed glaucoma valve implant surgery to treat secondary glaucoma due to chronic iridocyclitis in his left eye . After AGV means Ahmed glaucoma valve , he developed bullous keratopathy ( BK means bullous keratopathy ) in that eye . After Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty ( DSAEK means Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty ) was performed to treat BK means bullous keratopathy , the intraocular pressure ( IOP means intraocular pressure ) increased and early failure of the DSAEK means Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty resulted again in a cloudy cornea . We could not precisely detect any cause of AGV means Ahmed glaucoma valve failure with ordinary imaging instrumentation . An intraocular endoscope was used to determine that cause , and we found that the fibrous tissue occluded the tube of the AGV means Ahmed glaucoma valve . The IOP means intraocular pressure decreased soon after the tissue was removed . We conclude that intraocular endoscopy was useful for diagnosing AGV means Ahmed glaucoma valve failure with BK means bullous keratopathy .\n",
        "Having been approved for biological treatment of atopic dermatitis , dupilumab has also been recently licensed as add-on therapy for severe asthma and nasal polyposis . With regard to the latter diseases , few real-life clinical investigations have been carried out to date . The primary end point of this single-center observational study was to evaluate in a real-life setting the short-term therapeutic effects of dupilumab in patients with severe asthma and nasal polyposis . At baseline and after 4 weeks of add-on therapy with dupilumab , several clinical and functional parameters were assessed in 20 patients with severe asthma and nasal polyposis , including both allergic and nonallergic subjects . After 4 weeks of treatment with dupilumab , all patients experienced remarkable improvement in both severe asthma and nasal polyposis . In particular , asthma-control test and sinonasal outcome test 22 scores had significantly increased ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.0001 ) and decreased ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.0001 ) , respectively . Oral corticosteroid intake got to zero within 4 weeks ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.0001 ) . Moreover , in week 4 , significant increases were detected with regard to both prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.01 ) and forced vital capacity ( FVC ; < i > p</i>&lt;0.05 ) . At the same time point , dupilumab had significantly reduced residual volume ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.0001 ) and total lung capacity ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.001 ) , whereas it had enhanced forced midexpiratory flow of 25%-75 % FVC ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.01 ) and peak expiratory flow ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.01 ) . After 4 weeks of treatment , dupilumab had also lowered levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( < i > p</i>&lt;0.0001 ) . The results of this real-life study suggest that dupilumab can be utilized in both allergic and nonallergic patients with severe asthma and nasal polyposis as a valuable add-on biological therapy with rapid onset of action .\n",
        "Several studies have evaluated prophylactic emollients as a preventive strategy against atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and food allergy ( FA means food allergy ) . We aimed to synthesize the evidence on efficacy and safety of prophylactic emollients started during the first 6 weeks of infancy for prevention of AD means atopic dermatitis and FA means food allergy . MEDLINE , Embase , CINAHL , BIOSIS and the Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 to July 2020 , which assessed the effects of prophylactic emollients initiated within the first 6 weeks of life on the development of AD means atopic dermatitis within 24 months of age , compared to no treatment . Risk of bias and certainty of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool and GRADE process respectively . Of the 1486 articles identified , 10 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria . In infants given emollients , there was no significant reduction on the development of AD means atopic dermatitis ( risk ratio ( RR means risk ratio ) 0.84 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI means confidence interval ) 0.64 , 1.10 ) compared to the control group . However , there was significant benefit of prophylactic emollients ( RR means risk ratio 0.75 , 95 % CI means confidence interval 0.62 - 1.11 ) in the high-risk population ( n=8 studies ) . There was also significant benefit ( RR means risk ratio 0.59 , 95 % CI means confidence interval 0.43,0.81 ) in studies ( n=6 ) where emollients were used continuously to the point of AD means atopic dermatitis assessment ; but not when treatment was ceased for an interval before AD means atopic dermatitis assessment . There were no protective effects on FA means food allergy found . The prophylactic application of emollients initiated in early infancy may prevent AD means atopic dermatitis , especially in high-risk populations and when used continuously . We hypothesize that emollients may delay rather than prevent AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is the most common inflammatory skin disease in children . The serum level of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine ( TARC means thymus and activation-regulated chemokine ) is a useful AD means Atopic dermatitis index to reflect disease severity ; however , it requires blood collection from young children . In comparison , urine samples are easier to collect in a pediatric clinical setting . Here , we analyzed the lipids excreted in urine to identify a diagnostic biomarker for AD means Atopic dermatitis . We generated a murine dermatitis model by repeated topical application of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene ( DNFB means 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene ) or tape-stripping the dorsal skin . Lipid metabolites excreted in the urine were comprehensively analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . To corroborate our findings , we also analyzed urine samples from patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis . DNFB means 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene application induced AD-like skin lesions , including epidermal thickening , infiltration of eosinophils and T cells , and an increase in Th2 cytokine levels . Assessment of lipids excreted in urine showed a dominance of prostaglandins ( PGs means prostaglandins ) , namely , a PGF < sub>2α</sub > metabolite ( 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-tetranor-PGF < sub>1α</sub > ) , a PGE < sub>2</sub > metabolite ( 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-tetranor-PGE < sub>2</sub > ) , and a PGD < sub>2</sub > metabolite ( 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGJ < sub>2</sub > ) . mRNA and protein expression of PGF < sub>2α</sub > , PGE < sub>2</sub > , and PGD < sub>2</sub > synthase was upregulated in DNFB-treated skin . The tape-stripping model also caused dermatitis but without Th2 inflammation ; urine PGF < sub>2α</sub > and PGD < sub>2</sub > metabolite levels remained unaffected . Finally , we confirmed that the urinary levels of the aforementioned PG metabolites , as well as PGI < sub>2</sub > metabolite , 6,15-diketo-13,14-dihydro-PGF < sub>1α</sub > and arachidonic acid metabolite , 17-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( 17-HETE ) increased in patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis . Our data highlights the unique urinary lipid profile in patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , which may provide insight into novel urinary biomarkers for AD means Atopic dermatitis diagnosis .\n",
        "Aberrant CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling is involved in many pathophysiological processes such as cancer and inflammatory diseases . A natural fragment of serum albumin , named EPI-X4 , has previously been identified as endogenous peptide antagonist and inverse agonist of CXCR4 and is a promising compound for the development of improved analogues for the therapy of CXCR4-associated diseases . To generate optimized EPI-X4 derivatives we here performed molecular docking analysis to identify key interaction motifs of EPI-X4/CXCR4 . Subsequent rational drug design allowed to increase the anti-CXCR4 activity of EPI-X4 . The EPI-X4 derivative JM#21 bound CXCR4 and suppressed CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 infection more efficiently than the clinically approved small molecule CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 . EPI-X4 JM#21 did not exert toxic effects in zebrafish embryos and suppressed allergen-induced infiltration of eosinophils and other immune cells into the airways of animals in an asthma mouse model . Moreover , topical administration of the optimized EPI-X4 derivative efficiently prevented inflammation of the skin in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis . Thus , rationally designed EPI-X4 JM#21 is a novel potent antagonist of CXCR4 and the first CXCR4 inhibitor with therapeutic efficacy in atopic dermatitis . Further clinical development of this new class of CXCR4 antagonists for the therapy of atopic dermatitis , asthma and other CXCR4-associated diseases is highly warranted .\n",
        "Histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 ) has been known to regulate inflammatory diseases . The role of HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 in allergic skin inflammation has not been studied . We studied the role of HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and the mechanisms associated with it . The decreased expression or chemical inhibition of HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 suppressed AD means atopic dermatitis by decreasing autophagic flux and cellular features of AD means atopic dermatitis . AD means atopic dermatitis increased expression levels of the Th1 and Th2 cytokines , but decreased expression levels of forkhead box P3 ( FoxP3 means forkhead box P3 ) and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) in an HDAC6-dependent manner . CXC chemokine ligand 13 ( CXCL13 means CXC chemokine ligand 13 ) , which was increased in an HDAC6-depenednt manner , mediated AD means atopic dermatitis . MiR-9 , negatively regulated by HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 , suppressed AD means atopic dermatitis by directly regulating the expression of sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 means sirtuin 1 ) . The downregulation or inhibition of SIRT1 means sirtuin 1 suppressed AD means atopic dermatitis . Experiments employing culture medium and transwell suggested that cellular interactions involving mast cells , keratinocytes , and dermal fibroblast cells could promote AD means atopic dermatitis ; HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 and CXCL13 means CXC chemokine ligand 13 were found to be necessary for these cellular interactions . Mouse recombinant CXCL13 means CXC chemokine ligand 13 protein increased HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 expression in skin mast cells and dermal fibroblast cells . CXCL13 means CXC chemokine ligand 13 protein was found to be present in the exosomes of DNCB-treated skin mast cells . Exosomes of DNCB-treated skin mast cells enhanced invasion potentials of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblast cells and increased expression levels of HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 , SIRT1 means sirtuin 1 and CXCL13 means CXC chemokine ligand 13 in keratinocytes and dermal fibroblast cells . These results indicate that HDAC6 means Histone deacetylase 6 and CXCL13 means CXC chemokine ligand 13 may serve as targets for the developing anti-atopic drugs .\n",
        "Immunoglobulin ( Ig means Immunoglobulin ) E-mediated pathophysiological mechanisms are common in allergic diseases including severe allergic asthma ( SAA means severe allergic asthma ) . The anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab may be particularly beneficial for patients with SAA means severe allergic asthma and multiple allergic comorbidities ( AC means allergic comorbidities ) including perennial/seasonal rhinitis , conjunctivitis , atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , and food allergy . We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the patients from the STELLAIR study ( n=872 , 149 minors and 723 adults ) . The patients were classified based on the presence of multiple AC means allergic comorbidities ( ≥3 AC means allergic comorbidities or & lt;3 AC means allergic comorbidities ) or AD means atopic dermatitis as assessed by questionnaire . Response to omalizumab was assessed after 4 - 6 months ( T < sub>4 - 6</sub > ) and after 12 months ( T < sub>12</sub > ) . Asthma response at T < sub>4 - 6</sub > was based on global evaluation of treatment effectiveness , reduction of ≥40 % in annual exacerbation rate , and a combination of both . Asthma response at T < sub>12</sub > was based on change in yearly exacerbation and hospitalization rates . AC means allergic comorbidities improvement at T < sub>12</sub > was based on patient perception . Patients with ≥3 AC means allergic comorbidities demonstrated a higher combined response to omalizumab ( 74.7 % vs 58.3 % ) at T < sub>4 - 6</sub > and had reduced yearly exacerbation and hospitalization rates ( 88.9 % vs 77.4 % and -94.0 % vs -70.5 % , respectively ) . Patients with ≥3 AC means allergic comorbidities were more likely to show an improvement in their AC means allergic comorbidities ( 85.3 % vs 51.9 % ) at T < sub>12</sub>. Results were similar in minors and adults . The presence of AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with greater omalizumab effectiveness at T < sub>4 - 6</sub > and a greater AC means allergic comorbidities improvement at T < sub>12</sub>. Improvement of AD means atopic dermatitis and food allergies at T < sub>12</sub > were 73.2 % and 38.7 % , respectively , in the population overall . This post-hoc analysis of the STELLAIR study shows that omalizumab is beneficial for all SAA means severe allergic asthma patients and especially for patients with multiple AC means allergic comorbidities or AD means atopic dermatitis . In patients with ≥3 AC means allergic comorbidities , omalizumab also improved AC means allergic comorbidities outcomes .\n",

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease worldwide and displays many atopic , but also non-atopic comorbidities . Among the latter , mental health disorders such as depression have been extensively studied . However , data on addictions is still rare . The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of different kinds of addictions in adult AD means Atopic dermatitis patients using a single-center approach . This non-interventional cross-sectional study was performed from 03/2020 to 05/2020 at the Department of Dermatology of a large German university hospital . Participants with a diagnosis of AD means Atopic dermatitis confirmed by a dermatologist answered questions about disease severity ( Patient Oriented Eczema Measure , POEM ) , quality of life means Life Quality Index, DLQI ( Dermatology Life Quality Index , DLQI ) and smoking habits . They were screened for problematic alcohol consumption , drug abuse , internet addiction and pathological gambling using internationally established and validated questionnaires . 157 patients ( 56.1 % female ; mean age of 49.9 ± 20.4 ) with an average POEM of 13.7 ± 7.5 and DLQI of 6.1 ± 5.4 were evaluated . 14.1 % were identified as regular smokers , 12.1 % screened positive for alcohol dependency , 6.4 % for drug use disorders , 4.5 % for internet addiction and 3.2 % for pathological gambling . Co-occurrences of different addictions were observed and a positive correlation was noted between DLQI scores and smoking . In summary , this study hints at elevated positive screening rates for problematic alcohol consumption , drug use disorders , internet addiction and problem gambling compared to the general population . Screening routinely for addictions may improve patient-centered healthcare of AD means Atopic dermatitis patients .\n",
        "The dysregulation of skin microflora in patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) has become a research hotspot in recent years . Metagenomic studies have shown that microbial diversity is decreased , whereas the Staphylococcus aureus infection is increased in AD means atopic dermatitis . Keratinocytes are the primary barrier against the invasion of external pathogenic microorganisms . Staphylococcus aureus infection can abnormally activate innate and adaptive immune responses in keratinocytes , resulting in a vicious cycle between Staphylococcus aureus infection and AD means atopic dermatitis . This article reviews the mechanisms of inflammatory damage of keratinocytes induced by Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients with AD means atopic dermatitis , providing a theoretical basis for the study of new targeted drugs . This review also suggests for the management of Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients with AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "The incidence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) has recently increased due to various factors . Its prevalence is higher among children and teenagers than in other age groups . Numerous methods to treat AD means atopic dermatitis are available , including light ray therapy , which has been proposed as an alternative therapy for the treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis . The present study aimed to evaluate the curative mechanism and optimal energy level of energy irradiation from a low-level laser ( LLL means low-level laser ) toward AD means atopic dermatitis . AD means atopic dermatitis was induced in BALB/c mice with dinitrochlorobenzene ( DNCB means dinitrochlorobenzene ) solution . The mice were divided into six groups , including one normal control means control (n=10 ( n=8 ) , one AD means atopic dermatitis control means control (n=10 ( n=10 ) and four AD means atopic dermatitis experimental groups with LLL means low-level laser irradiation at 2 J/cm < sup>2</sup > ( n=10 ) , 4 J/cm < sup>2</sup > ( n=10 ) , 6 J/cm < sup>2</sup > ( n=9 ) and 8 J/cm < sup>2</sup > ( n=10 ) . Following AD means atopic dermatitis induction , an LLL means low-level laser was applied to the four AD means atopic dermatitis experimental groups for 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 min , for two weeks ( 14 times in total ) at a wavelength of 650 nm and an output of 50 mW. The effects of irradiation on AD means atopic dermatitis were evaluated using a scratch test , a clinical skin severity test , immunoglobulin-E ( IgE means immunoglobulin-E ) analysis and measurements of numerous cytokine levels , including interleukin (IL)-4 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α , and interferon-γ ( IFN-γ means interferon-γ ) , tissue thickness and mast cell count . The results demonstrated that serum IgE means immunoglobulin-E level in all irradiated groups was significantly decreased compared with that of the AD means atopic dermatitis control means control (n=10 group , and IL-4 level was significantly decreased in all irradiated groups apart from the 8 J/cm < sup>2</sup > LLL means low-level laser irradiated group . IL-6 and TNF-α levels were also significantly decreased in all irradiated groups . The results from histological analysis revealed diminished epidermal thickness and mast cell counts in irradiated mice compared with those mice in the AD means atopic dermatitis control means control (n=10 group . In summary , these findings suggested that LLL means low-level laser irradiation may alleviate symptoms of AD means atopic dermatitis and may be useful for restoring cytokines levels and tissues features to normal levels .\n",
        "Many common and rare variants associated with hematologic traits have been discovered through imputation on large-scale reference panels . However , the majority of genome-wide association studies ( GWASs means genome-wide association studies ) have been conducted in Europeans , and determining causal variants has proved challenging . We performed a GWAS of total leukocyte , neutrophil , lymphocyte , monocyte , eosinophil , and basophil counts generated from 109,563,748 variants in the autosomes and the X chromosome in the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed means Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ) program , which included data from 61,802 individuals of diverse ancestry . We discovered and replicated 7 leukocyte trait associations , including ( 1 ) the association between a chromosome X , pseudo-autosomal region ( PAR means pseudo-autosomal region ) , noncoding variant located between cytokine receptor genes ( CSF2RA and CLRF2 ) and lower eosinophil count ; and ( 2 ) associations between single variants found predominantly among African Americans at the S1PR3 ( 9q22.1 ) and HBB ( 11p15.4 ) loci and monocyte and lymphocyte counts , respectively . We further provide evidence indicating that the newly discovered eosinophil-lowering chromosome X PAR means pseudo-autosomal region variant might be associated with reduced susceptibility to common allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma . Additionally , we found a burden of very rare FLT3 ( 13q12.2 ) variants associated with monocyte counts . Together , these results emphasize the utility of whole-genome sequencing in diverse samples in identifying associations missed by European-ancestry-driven GWASs means genome-wide association studies .\n",
        "Hospitalized preterm infants with compromised skin barrier function treated topically with sunflower seed oil ( SSO means sunflower seed oil ) have shown reductions in sepsis and neonatal mortality rate ( NMR means neonatal mortality rate ) . Mustard oil and products commonly used in high-mortality settings may possibly harm skin barrier integrity and enhance risk of infection and mortality in newborn infants . We hypothesized that SSO means sunflower seed oil therapy may reduce NMR means neonatal mortality rate in such settings . This was a population-based , cluster randomized , controlled trial in 276 clusters means clusters in rural Uttar Pradesh , India . All newborn infants identified through population-based surveillance in the study clusters means clusters within 7 days of delivery were enrolled from November 2014 to October 2016 . Exclusive , 3 times daily , gentle applications of 10 ml of SSO means sunflower seed oil to newborn infants by families throughout the neonatal period were recommended in intervention clusters means clusters ( n = 138 clusters means clusters ) ; infants in comparison clusters means clusters ( n = 138 clusters means clusters ) received usual care , such as massage practice typically with mustard oil . Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat with NMR means neonatal mortality rate and post-24-hour NMR means neonatal mortality rate as the primary outcomes . Secondary analysis included per-protocol analysis and subgroup analyses for NMR means neonatal mortality rate . Regression analysis was adjusted for caste , first-visit weight , delivery attendant , gravidity , maternal age , maternal education , sex of the infant , and multiple births . We enrolled 13,478 ( 52.2 % male , mean weight : 2,575.0 grams ± standard deviation [ SD ] 521.0 ) and 13,109 ( 52.0 % male , mean weight : 2,607.0 grams ± SD 509.0 ) newborn infants in the intervention and comparison clusters means clusters , respectively . We found no overall difference in NMR means neonatal mortality rate in the intervention versus the comparison clusters means clusters [ adjusted odds ratio ( aOR means adjusted odds ratio ) 0.96 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI means confidence interval ) 0.84 to 1.11 , p = 0.61 ] . Acceptance of SSO means sunflower seed oil in the intervention arm was high at 89.3 % , but adherence to exclusive applications of SSO means sunflower seed oil was 30.4 % . Per-protocol analysis showed a significant 58 % ( 95 % CI means confidence interval 42 % to 69 % , p & lt ; 0.01 ) reduction in mortality among infants in the intervention group who were treated exclusively with SSO means sunflower seed oil as intended versus infants in the comparison group who received exclusive applications of mustard oil . A significant 52 % ( 95 % CI means confidence interval 12 % to 74 % , p = 0.02 ) reduction in NMR means neonatal mortality rate was observed in the subgroup of infants weighing ≤1,500 g ( n = 589 ) ; there were no statistically significant differences in other prespecified subgroup comparisons by low birth weight ( LBW means low birth weight ) , birthplace , and wealth . No severe adverse events ( SAEs means severe adverse events ) were attributable to the intervention . The study was limited by inability to mask allocation to study workers or participants and by measurement of emollient use based on caregiver responses and not actual observation . In this trial , we observed that promotion of SSO means sunflower seed oil therapy universally for all newborn infants was not effective in reducing NMR means neonatal mortality rate . However , this result may not necessarily establish equivalence between SSO means sunflower seed oil and mustard oil massage in light of our secondary findings . Mortality reduction in the subgroup of infants ≤1,500 g was consistent with previous hospital-based efficacy studies , potentially extending the applicability of emollient therapy in very low-birth-weight ( VLBW means very low-birth-weight ) infants along the facility-community continuum . Further research is recommended to develop and evaluate therapeutic regimens and continuum of care delivery strategies for emollient therapy for newborn infants at highest risk of compromised skin barrier function .

        "Long-COVID refers to a variety of symptoms affecting different organs reported by people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 ) infection . To date , there have been no robust estimates of the incidence and co-occurrence of long-COVID features , their relationship to age , sex , or severity of infection , and the extent to which they are specific to COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 . The aim of this study is to address these issues . We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on linked electronic health records ( EHRs means electronic health records ) data from 81 million patients including 273,618 COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 survivors . The incidence and co-occurrence within 6 months and in the 3 to 6 months after COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 diagnosis were calculated for 9 core features of long-COVID ( breathing difficulties/breathlessness , fatigue/malaise , chest/throat pain , headache , abdominal symptoms , myalgia , other pain , cognitive symptoms , and anxiety/depression ) . Their co-occurrence network was also analyzed . Comparison with a propensity score-matched cohort of patients diagnosed with influenza during the same time period was achieved using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model . The incidence of atopic dermatitis was used as a negative control . Among COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 survivors ( mean [ SD ] age : 46.3 [ 19.8 ] , 55.6 % female ) , 57.00 % had one or more long-COVID feature recorded during the whole 6-month period ( i.e. , including the acute phase ) , and 36.55 % between 3 and 6 months . The incidence of each feature was : abnormal breathing ( 18.71 % in the 1- to 180-day period ; 7.94 % in the 90- to180-day period ) , fatigue/malaise ( 12.82 % ; 5.87 % ) , chest/throat pain ( 12.60 % ; 5.71 % ) , headache ( 8.67 % ; 4.63 % ) , other pain ( 11.60 % ; 7.19 % ) , abdominal symptoms ( 15.58 % ; 8.29 % ) , myalgia ( 3.24 % ; 1.54 % ) , cognitive symptoms ( 7.88 % ; 3.95 % ) , and anxiety/depression ( 22.82 % ; 15.49 % ) . All 9 features were more frequently reported after COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 than after influenza ( with an overall excess incidence of 16.60 % and hazard ratios between 1.44 and 2.04 , all p & lt ; 0.001 ) , co-occurred more commonly , and formed a more interconnected network . Significant differences in incidence and co-occurrence were associated with sex , age , and illness severity . Besides the limitations inherent to EHR data , limitations of this study include that ( i ) the findings do not generalize to patients who have had COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 but were not diagnosed , nor to patients who do not seek or receive medical attention when experiencing symptoms of long-COVID ; ( ii ) the findings say nothing about the persistence of the clinical features ; and ( iii ) the difference between cohorts might be affected by one cohort seeking or receiving more medical attention for their symptoms . Long-COVID clinical features occurred and co-occurred frequently and showed some specificity to COVID-19 means Coronavirus Disease 2019 , though they were also observed after influenza . Different long-COVID clinical profiles were observed based on demographics and illness severity .\n",
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 ) pandemic started on March 2020 and caused over 4.5 million confirmed deaths worldwide as far August 2021 . We have been recently overwhelmed by a wide literature on how the immune system recognizes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and contributes to COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 pathogenesis . Although originally considered a respiratory viral disease , COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 is now recognized as a far more complex , multi-organ- , immuno-mediated- , and mostly heterogeneous disorder . Though efficient innate and adaptive immunity may control infection , when the patient fails to mount an adequate immune response at start , or in advanced disease , a high innate-induced inflammation can lead to different clinical outcomes through heterogeneous compensatory mechanisms . The variability of viral load and persistence , the genetic alterations of virus-driven receptors/signaling pathways and the plasticity of innate and adaptive responses may all account for the extreme heterogeneity of pathogenesis and clinical patterns . As recently applied to some inflammatory disorders as asthma , rhinosinusitis with polyposis and atopic dermatitis , herein we suggest to define different endo-types and the related phenotypes along COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 . Patients should be stratified for evolving symptoms and tightly monitored for surrogate biomarkers of innate and adaptive immunity . This would allow to preventively identify each endo-type ( and its related phenotype ) and to treat patients precisely with agents targeting pathogenic mechanisms .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory allergic skin disease , characterized by pruritic and eczematous skin lesions . < i > Lycopus lucidus</i > Turcz ( LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz ) is a perennial herb that has been reported to have various biological properties , including effects on blood circulation , as well as anti‑inflammatory , antioxidant , anti‑vascular inflammation and wound‑healing effects . However , whether LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz improves dermatitis and the underlying mechanisms has yet to be determined . The aim of the present study was to determine whether LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz can improve 2,4‑dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)‑induced dermatitis and to verify the inhibitory effect of LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz on the expression of chemokines and pro‑inflammatory cytokines in the HaCaT immortalized keratinocyte cell line . In addition , the anti‑inflammatory function of LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages was investigated . In the DNCB‑induced AD means Atopic dermatitis mouse model , LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz inhibited infiltration by mast cells , eosinophils and CD8<sup>+</sup > cells in the dorsal skin tissue of AD means Atopic dermatitis mice , and suppressed the expression of IgE and IL‑6 in serum . In addition , LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK , as well as NF‑κB in skin tissue . In the HaCaT cell model induced by TNF‑α/IFN‑γ , LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz inhibited the expression of thymus and activation‑regulated chemokine , granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor , monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 , TNF‑α and IL‑1β , whilst inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF‑κB. In addition , in the lipopolysaccharide‑induced RAW 264.7 cell inflammation model , LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz inhibited the expression of TNF‑α and IFN‑γ , the nuclear translocation of NF‑κB and the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK . These results suggested that LLT means Lycopus lucidus</i> Turcz may be a promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory dermatitis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a pruritic , chronic , relapsing inflammatory skin disease . The research aims to study the effects of Sarsasapogenin and its combination with Fluticasone in 2 , 4-Dinitrofluorobenzene ( DNFB means 4-Dinitrofluorobenzene ) induced atopic dermatitis in BALB/c mice . Thirty male Balb/c mice were divided into 5 groups : ( i ) Normal control ( NC means Normal control ) , ( ii ) Disease control ( DNFB means 4-Dinitrofluorobenzene ) , ( iii ) Sarsasapogenin ( SG means Sarsasapogenin ) ( 50 µg/mice ) , ( iv ) Fluticasone ( FC means Fluticasone ) ( 50 µg/mice ) , ( v ) Sarsasapogenin + Fluticasone ( SG means Sarsasapogenin + FC means Fluticasone ) combination ( 25 µg/mice ) . Dermatitis was induced by repeated application of DNFB means 4-Dinitrofluorobenzene in Balb/c mice . On topical application of SG means Sarsasapogenin , FC means Fluticasone , and SG means Sarsasapogenin + FC means Fluticasone combination on the ear and skin lesions , body weight , ear weight , ear thickness , erythema score , spleen weight , cytokines , immunoglobulin E ( IgE means immunoglobulin E ) levels , nitric oxide ( NO means nitric oxide ) level , hematological parameters , and oxidative stress markers were evaluated . Histological analysis of the ear tissue was also done . The results stated that SG means Sarsasapogenin and SG means Sarsasapogenin + FC means Fluticasone treatment to mice considerably decrease the ear weight , ear thickness , spleen weight , serum IgE means immunoglobulin E , cytokines , NO means nitric oxide levels , and restoration of antioxidant stress markers with elevation in the hematological parameters . The observations were further confirmed by histopathological analysis of ear tissue . These data specify that SG means Sarsasapogenin has been demonstrated as a probable therapy for the treatment of allergic skin diseases in combination with FC means Fluticasone by decreasing its dose from 50 to 25 µg/mice to avoid the chronic side effects of FC means Fluticasone . Hence , it can be concluded that SG means Sarsasapogenin and SG means Sarsasapogenin + FC means Fluticasone combination significantly improved the AD-like symptoms in the DNFB means 4-Dinitrofluorobenzene sensitized mice through mitigating the production of proinflammatory mediators and restoration of oxidative stress markers .\n",
        "Black race is associated with increased atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) severity and healthcare resource utilization . However , the burden of out-of-pocket ( OOP means out-of-pocket ) expenses among black individuals with AD means atopic dermatitis is not well understood . We sought to characterize the categories and impact of OOP means out-of-pocket healthcare expenses associated with AD means atopic dermatitis management among black individuals . A 25-question voluntary online survey was administered to National Eczema Association members ( N = 113,502 ) . Inclusion criteria ( US residents age ≥ 18 years ; self-report of AD means atopic dermatitis or primary caregivers of individuals with AD means atopic dermatitis ) was met by 77.3 % ( 1118/1447 ) of respondents . Black individuals with AD means atopic dermatitis were younger , had lower household income , Medicaid , urban residence , poor AD means atopic dermatitis control and frequent skin infections ( P ≤ 0.02 ) . Blacks vs. non-blacks reported more OOP means out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications covered ( 74.2 % vs. 63.6 % , P = 0.04 ) and not covered ( 65.1 % vs. 46.5 % , P = 0.0004 ) by insurance , emergency room visits ( 22.1 % vs. 11.8 % , P = 0.005 ) , and outpatient laboratory testing ( 33.3 % vs. 21.8 % , P = 0.01 ) . Black race was associated with increased household financial impact from OOP means out-of-pocket expenses ( P = 0.0009 ) , and predictors of financial impact included minimally controlled AD means atopic dermatitis ( adjusted OR [ 95 % CI ] 13.88 [ 1.63 - 117.96 ] , P = 0.02 ) , systemic therapy ( 4.34 [ 1.63 - 11.54 ] , 0.003 ) , & gt ; $ 200 monthly OOP means out-of-pocket expenses ( 14.28 [ 3.42 - 59.60 ] , P = 0.0003 ) , and Medicaid ( 4.02 [ 1.15 - 14.07 ] , P = 0.03 ) . Blacks with Medicaid had higher odds of harmful financial impact ( 3.32 [ 1.77 - 6.24 ] , P = 0.0002 ) than those of black race ( 1.81 [ 1.04 - 3.15 ] , P = 0.04 ) or with Medicaid ( 1.39 [ 1.02 - 1.88 ] , P = 0.04 ) alone .

        "The incidence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , a disease characterized by an abnormal immune balance and skin barrier function , has increased rapidly in developed countries . This study investigated the anti-atopic effect of < i > Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i > ( LE means Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> ) using NC/Nga mice induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene . LE means Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> reduced AD means atopic dermatitis clinical symptoms , including inflammatory cell infiltration , epidermal thickness , ear thickness , and scratching behavior , in the mice . Additionally , LE means Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> reduced serum IgE and histamine levels , and restored the T helper ( Th means T helper ) 1/Th2 immune balance through regulation of the IgG1/IgG2a ratio . LE means Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> also reduced the levels of AD-related cytokines and chemokines , including interleukin (IL)-1β , IL-4 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α means tumor necrosis factor-α ) , thymic stromal lymphopoietin , thymus and activation-regulated chemokine , macrophage-derived chemokine , regulated on activation , normal T cell expressed and secreted , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the serum . Moreover , LE means Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> modulated AD-related cytokines and chemokines expressed and secreted by Th1 , Th2 , Th17 , and Th22 cells in the dorsal skin and splenocytes . Furthermore , LE means Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> restored skin barrier function by increasing pro-filaggrin gene expression and levels of skin barrier-related proteins filaggrin , involucrin , loricrin , occludin , and zonula occludens-1 . These results suggest that LE means Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i> is a potential therapeutic agent that can alleviate AD means atopic dermatitis by modulating Th1/Th2 immune balance and restoring skin barrier function .\n",
        "Specific partially hydrolysed whey-based infant formulas ( pHF-W ) have been shown to decrease the risk of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in infants . Historically , AD means atopic dermatitis has been associated primarily with milk allergy ; however , defective skin barrier function can be a primary cause of AD means atopic dermatitis . We aimed to ascertain whether oral supplementation with pHF-W can improve skin barrier function . The effect of pHF-W was assessed on transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) and antibody productions in mice epicutaneously exposed to < i > Aspergillus fumigatus</i>. Human primary keratinocytes were stimulated in vitro , and the expression of genes related to skin barrier function was measured . Supplementation with pHF-W in neonatal mice led to a significant decrease in TEWL means transepidermal water loss and total IgE , but not in allergen-specific antibody levels . The whey hydrolysate was sufficient to decrease both TEWL means transepidermal water loss and total IgE. Aquaporin-3 gene expression , linked with skin hydration , was modulated in the skin of mice and human primary keratinocytes following protein hydrolysate exposure . Skin barrier improvement may be an additional mechanism by which pHF-W may potentially reduce the risk of AD means atopic dermatitis development in infants . Further human studies are warranted to confirm the clinical efficacy of these observations .\n",
        "Human clinical trials have shown that a specific partially hydrolyzed 100 % whey-based infant formula ( pHF-W ) reduces AD risk in the first yeast of life . Meta-analyses with a specific pHF-W ( pHF-W1 ) confirm a protective effect while other meta-analyses pooling different pHF-W show conflicting results . Here we investigated the molecular composition and functional properties of the specific pHF-W1 as well as the stability of its manufacturing process over time . This specific pHF-W1 was compared with other pHF-Ws . We used size exclusion chromatography to characterize the peptide molecular weight ( MW means molecular weight ) , a rat basophil degranulation assay to assess the relative level of beta-lactoglobulin ( BLG means beta-lactoglobulin ) allergenicity and a preclinical model of oral tolerance induction to test prevention of allergic sensitization . To analyze the exact peptide sequences before and after an HLA binding assay , a mass cytometry approach was used . Peptide size allergenicity and oral tolerance induction were conserved across pHF-W1 batches of production and time . The median MW means molecular weight of the 37 samples of pHF-W1 tested was 800 ± 400 Da . Further oral tolerance induction was observed using 10 different batches of the pHF-W1 with a mean reduction of BLG-specific IgE levels of 0.76 log ( 95 % CI = -0.95 ; -0.57 ) . When comparing pHF-W1 with three other formulas ( pHF-W2 3 and 4 ) , peptide size was not necessarily associated with allergenicity reduction in vitro nor oral tolerance induction in vivo as measured by specific IgE level ( < i > p</i > & lt ; 0.05 for pHF-W1 and 2 and < i > p</i > = 0.271 and < i > p</i > = 0.189 for pHF-W3 and 4 respectively ) . Peptide composition showed a limited overlap between the formulas tested ranging from 11.7 % to 24.2 % . Furthermore nine regions in the BLG means beta-lactoglobulin sequence were identified as binding HLA-DR . In conclusion , not all pHF-Ws tested have the same peptide size distribution decreased allergenicity and ability to induce oral tolerance . Specific peptides are released during the different processes used by different infant formula producers .\n",
        "Administration of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs means active pharmaceutical ingredients ) through the skin , by means of topical drug delivery systems , is an advanced therapeutic approach . As the skin is the largest organ of the human body , primarily acting as a natural protective barrier against permeation of xenobiotics , specific strategies to overcome this barrier are needed . Liposomes are nanometric-sized delivery systems composed of phospholipids , which are key components of cell membranes , making liposomes well tolerated and devoid of toxicity . As their lipid compositions are similar to those of the skin , liposomes are used as topical , dermal , and transdermal delivery systems . However , permeation of the first generation of liposomes through the skin posed some limitations ; thus , a second generation of liposomes has emerged , overcoming permeability problems . Various mechanisms of permeation/penetration of elastic/ultra-deformable liposomes into the skin have been proposed ; however , debate continues on their extent/mechanisms of permeation/penetration . In vivo bioavailability of an API administered in the form of ultra-deformable liposomes is similar to the bioavailability achieved when the same API is administered in the form of a solution by subcutaneous or epi-cutaneous injection , which demonstrates their applicability in transdermal drug delivery .\n",

The compound structures were identified primarily by NMR and MS analyses . Atopic dermatitis , an inflammatory disease , is driven by the abnormal activation of T helper ( Th means T helper ) 2 cells and barrier dysfunction . We attempted to identify the anti-inflammatory components of SF-7343 . Initial screening showed that compounds < b>1</b > and < b>3</b > inhibited the secretion of interleukin-8 and -6 in tumor necrosis factor-α/interferon-γ-treated HaCaT cells , and these compounds also showed inhibitory effects on CCL5 and CCL22 . Compounds < b>1</b > and < b>3</b > also downregulated the protein expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and upregulated the expression of filaggrin and involcurin . The mechanism study results showed that compounds < b>1</b > and < b>3</b > inhibited nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 and the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 . Compound < b>1</b > , but not compound < b>3</b > , significantly promoted the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 . The effects of compound < b>1</b > were partly reversed by co-treatment with a HO-1 inhibitor , tin protoporphyrin IX . Taken together , this study demonstrates the potential value of Antarctic fungal strain SF-7343 isolates as a bioresource for bioactive compounds to prevent skin inflammation .\n",
        "Association between the gut mycobiome and atopic dermatitis was investigated in 9 - 12-month-old infants using metagenomics . Two groups of atopic dermatitis infants were classified according to their symptom development as outgrown ( recovered ) and persisted ( still undergoing ) . The evenness and diversity of the mycobiome in the persisted group were higher than in the healthy and outgrown groups . Dysbiosis of the microbiome in the persisted group was observed by a reduction in the < i > Ascomycota</i>/<i > Basidiomycota</i > ratio . Five fungi were selected as markers from each sample group . In the persisted group , < i > Rhodotorula</i > sp. abundance increased significantly , while < i > Wickerhamomyces</i > sp. and < i > Kodamaea</i > sp. abundance increased in the healthy group , and < i > Acremonium</i > sp. and < i > Rhizopus</i > sp. abundance increased considerably in the outgrown group . Metaproteomic analysis revealed that the persisted group had a high abundance of fungal proteins , particularly those from < i > Rhodotorula</i > sp. Unique proteins such as RAN-binding protein 1 and glycerol kinase from < i > Rhodotorula</i > sp. were hypothesized to be related to atopic dermatitis manifestation in infants .\n",

An increasing number of reports indicate that inflammation of the brain leads to neurodegenerative changes , especially during perinatal life , \" short-circuiting the electrical system \" in the amygdala that is essential for our ability to feel emotions , but also regulates fear . Inflammation of the brain can result from the stimulation of mast cells-found in all tissues including the brain-by neuropeptides , stress , toxins , and viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 , leading to the activation of microglia . These resident brain defenders then release even more inflammatory molecules and stop \" pruning \" nerve connections , disrupting neuronal connectivity , lowering the fear threshold , and derailing the expression of emotions , as seen in ASD means autism spectrum disorder . Many epidemiological studies have reported a strong association between ASD means autism spectrum disorder and atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) , asthma , and food allergies/intolerance , all of which involve activated mast cells . Mast cells can be triggered by allergens , neuropeptides , stress , and toxins , leading to disruption of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB means blood-brain barrier ) and activation of microglia . Moreover , many epidemiological studies have reported a strong association between stress and atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) during gestation , which involves activated mast cells . Both mast cells and microglia can also be activated by SARS-CoV-2 in affected mothers during pregnancy . We showed increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 and its receptor , but decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-38 and its receptor IL-36R , only in the amygdala of deceased children with ASD means autism spectrum disorder . We further showed that the natural flavonoid luteolin is a potent inhibitor of the activation of both mast cells and microglia , but also blocks SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 means angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ) . A treatment approach should be tailored to each individual patient and should address hyperactivity/stress , allergies , or food intolerance , with the introduction of natural molecules or drugs to inhibit mast cells and microglia , such as liposomal luteolin .\n",
        "Baicalein ( 5,6,7-trihydroxy-2-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one ) , a flavonoid analog from < i > Scutellaria baicalensis</i > , possesses several pharmacological activities including antioxidant , antiproliferative , and anti-inflammatory activities . We previously reported that baicalein inhibits the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)/TSLP receptor ( TSLPR means (TSLP)/TSLP receptor ) signaling pathways and can be used as an active ingredient in the treatment of asthma and atopic dermatitis . However , baicalein is rapidly metabolized to baicalin and baicalein-6-<i > O</i>-glucuronide in vivo , which limits its preclinical and clinical use . In this study , we designed , synthesized , and evaluated baicalein prodrugs that protect the OH group at the 7-position of the A ring in baicalein with the amino acid carbamate functional group . Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies identified compound < b>2</b > as a baicalein prodrug candidate that improved the plasma exposure of baicalein in mouse animal studies . Our results demonstrated that this prodrug approach could be further adopted to discover oral baicalein prodrugs .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is difficult to treat . Traditional cold cream , a water-in-oil emulsion made from beeswax , is used to alleviate AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms in clinical practice , although its effectiveness has not been scientifically proven . The addition of propolis has the potential to impart anti-inflammatory properties to cold cream . However , in high concentrations , propolis can trigger allergic reactions . Thus , the objective of this work was to develop a cold cream formulation based on purified beeswax containing the same amount of green propolis present in raw beeswax . The impact of adding this low propolis concentration to cold cream on AD means Atopic dermatitis control was evaluated in patients compared to cold cream without added propolis ( CBlank ) . Raw beeswax was chemically characterized to define the propolis concentration added to the propolis-loaded cold cream ( CPropolis means concentration added to the propolis-loaded cold cream ) . The creams were characterized as to their physicochemical , mechanical , and rheological characteristics . The effect of CPropolis means concentration added to the propolis-loaded cold cream and CBlank on the quality of life , disease severity , and skin hydration of patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis was evaluated in a triple-blind randomized preclinical study . Concentrations of 34 to 120 ng/mL of green propolis extract reduced TNF-α levels in LPS-stimulated macrophage culture . The addition of propolis to cold cream did not change the cream 's rheological , mechanical , or bioadhesive properties . The preclinical study suggested that both creams improved the patient 's quality of life . Furthermore , the use of CPropolis means concentration added to the propolis-loaded cold cream decreased the disease severity compared to CBlank .\n",
        "Many relatively common chronic inflammatory skin diseases manifest on the face ( seborrheic dermatitis , rosacea , acne , perioral/periorificial dermatitis , periocular dermatitis , etc . ) , thereby significantly impairing patient appearance and quality of life . Given the yet unexplained pathogenesis and numerous factors involved , these diseases often present therapeutic challenges . The term \" microbiome \" comprises the totality of microorganisms ( microbiota ) , their genomes , and environmental factors in a particular environment . Changes in human skin microbiota composition and/or functionality are believed to trigger immune dysregulation , and consequently an inflammatory response , thereby playing a potentially significant role in the clinical manifestations and treatment of these diseases . Although cultivation methods have traditionally been used in studies of bacterial microbiome species , a large number of bacterial strains can not be grown in the laboratory . Since standard culture-dependent methods detect fewer than 1 % of all bacterial species , a metagenomic approach could be used to detect bacteria that can not be cultivated . The skin microbiome exhibits spatial distribution associated with the microenvironment ( sebaceous , moist , and dry areas ) . However , although disturbance of the skin microbiome can lead to a number of pathological conditions and diseases , it is still not clear whether skin diseases result from change in the microbiome or cause such a change . Thus far , the skin microbiome has been studied in atopic dermatitis , seborrheic dermatitis , psoriasis , acne , and rosacea . Studies on the possible association between changes in the microbiome and their association with skin diseases have improved the understanding of disease development , diagnostics , and therapeutics . The identification of the bacterial markers associated with particular inflammatory skin diseases would significantly accelerate the diagnostics and reduce treatment costs . Microbiota research and determination could facilitate the identification of potential causes of skin diseases that can not be detected by simpler methods , thereby contributing to the design and development of more effective therapies .\n",
        "The global epidemiology of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in the current decade ( 2009 - 2019 ) has not been extensively reported . Epidemiological studies play an important role in presenting the risk factors of AD means atopic dermatitis , as detailed prevalence and incidence data could demonstrate the burden of disease in the population of adults , adolescents , and children in different geographical regions . Thus , the primary objective of this review was to assess and summarize the epidemiological studies of the prevalence and incidence of AD means atopic dermatitis in different age groups , focusing on data from studies published for 2009 to 2019 . After a thorough literature search , six countries were identified from African , Asian , and European regions respectively , who published studies on AD means atopic dermatitis . In contrast , only two studies were identified from Australia and New Zealand , three countries from North America and two from South America published AD means atopic dermatitis studies , respectively . The highest prevalence of AD means atopic dermatitis from included studies was noted among Swedish children with 34 % , while the lowest prevalence was in Tunisian children with 0.65 % ; studies reporting incidence data were far less numerous . A common trend in the prevalence of AD means atopic dermatitis was that children would have a higher prevalence as compared to adolescents and adults . The severity and morbidity of the disease showed variance with age , sex , socioeconomic characteristics , geographical location , and ethnicity . Environmental factors played an important role as causative agents in AD means atopic dermatitis . The risk factors that were proven to cause and induce AD means atopic dermatitis were skin barrier impairments due to FLG mutation , changes in the environment , and diet . FLG mutation may impair the skin barrier function by disruption of pH and hydration maintenance of the skin . Lastly , there were only a few studies on the incidence of AD means atopic dermatitis in the 21st century . Therefore , epidemiological studies on childhood and adulthood AD means atopic dermatitis in different continents are still needed , especially on the incidence of AD means atopic dermatitis during adulthood .\n",
        "Some Network Meta-analysis ( NMA means Network Meta-analysis ) has been published regarding atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . These studies have considered drugs under investigation both in monotheraphy or in combination with topical corticosteroids , as well as systemic immunosuppressant therapies . The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biological agents and small molecules in AD means atopic dermatitis . A systematic review and NMA means Network Meta-analysis of biologics agents and small molecules in AD means atopic dermatitis was performed . A literature search was performed using MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for clinical trials and systematic reviews between January 2000 and 19 December 2020 . Only randomized clinical trials ( RCTs means randomized clinical trials ) were included . It was limited to English language and adult human subjects . Two networks were evaluated : monotherapy and combination with TCS means topical corticosteroid . The two primary outcomes were Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) 75 and EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index 90 change from baseline to week 12 - 16 , depending on source study cut-off . The Cochrane 's Risk of Bias tool 2011 update was used to analyze the risk of bias , focused on the primary objectives . 30 RCTs means randomized clinical trials ( included in 26 publications ) were included in the systematic review . Finally , 23 RCTs means randomized clinical trials were included in the quantitative analysis ( 14 RCTs means randomized clinical trials including 3582 patients in monotherapy ; and 9 RCTs means randomized clinical trials including 3686 patients with TCS means topical corticosteroid ) . In monotherapy , a higher percentage of patients achieving EASI-75 was obtained with Upadacitinib 30 mg [ OR : 18.90 ( 13.94 ; 25.62 ) ] followed by Abrocitinib 200 mg [ OR = 11.26 ( 7.02 ; 18.05 ) ] and Upadacitinib 15 mg [ OR : 10.89 ( 8.13 ; 14.59 ) ] . These results were also observed in studies where the use of topical corticosteroid ( TCS means topical corticosteroid ) was allowed ( OR Upadacitinib 30 mg = 9.43 ; OR Abrocitinib 200 mg = 6.12 ; OR Upadacitinib 15 mg = 5.20 ) . Regarding IGA , the percentage of patients achieving IGA0/1 was higher with both doses of Upadacitinib 30 mg [ OR : 19.13 ( 13.14 ; 27.85 ) ] and 15 mg [ OR = 10.95 ( 7.52 ; 15.94 ) . In studies where the use of TCS means topical corticosteroid were allowed , however , the dose of Abrocitinib 200 mg [ OR = 6.10 ( 3.94 ; 9.44 ) ] showed higher efficacy than Upadacitinib 15 mg [ OR = 5.47 ( 3.57 ; 8.41 ) ] . Regarding safety , the drugs with the highest probability of presenting adverse effects were the Janus kinases ( JAK means Janus kinases ) inhibitors , Upadacitinib and Abrocitinib in monotherapy and Baricitinib in combination with TCS means topical corticosteroid . Some risks of bias have been found , which must be taken into account when interpreting the results . The funnel plot shows a possible publication bias that may underestimate the efficacy of drugs . Upadacitinib and Abrocitinib are the drugs with the highest efficacy , both in monotherapy and in association with TCS means topical corticosteroid . However , they were also those associated with the highest risk of adverse effects , showing monoclonal antibodies better safety profile . We have included molecules still in the development phase as well studies completed and presented at conferences and with data available in Trialsgov < sup> ® </sup > but not published yet . Several molecules ' development had included a small number of patients from 12 to 17 years of age , without being able to differentiate the results from the adult population .

        "The prevalence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in children has steadily increased over time , yet it remains largely unknown how maternal factors during pregnancy are associated with child AD means atopic dermatitis . Few studies have specifically assessed the relationship between prenatal stress and child AD means atopic dermatitis , with inconsistent findings . In this prospective cohort study following 426 mother-child dyads from pregnancy to middle childhood , women reported stressful life events ( SLEs means stressful life events ) experienced during the 12 months before delivery and AD means atopic dermatitis outcomes in children aged approximately 4 - 6 years , including current , location-specific , and ever AD means atopic dermatitis . We used Poisson regression to estimate risk ratios ( RRs means risk ratios ) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs means confidence intervals ) associated with a 1-unit increase in prenatal SLEs means stressful life events , adjusting for potential confounders . We also assessed whether the association between prenatal SLEs means stressful life events and child AD means atopic dermatitis was modified by child sex , history of maternal atopy , or prenatal maternal resilient coping . The mean ( standard deviation ) of prenatal SLEs means stressful life events reported in the overall sample was 1.4 ( 1.6 ) , with 37.1 % of women reporting none . A 1-unit increase in prenatal SLEs means stressful life events was not significantly associated with current AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR : 1.08 , 95 % CI : 0.89 , 1.31 ) , location-specific AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR : 1.09 , 95 % CI : 0.78 , 1.52 ) , or ever AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR : 0.97 , 95 % CI : 0.87 , 1.09 ) . We did not find evidence of effect modification . Findings from this study suggest no association between prenatal SLEs means stressful life events and AD means atopic dermatitis in middle childhood , although larger longitudinal studies with enhanced case definition and higher variability of SLE experience may more fully inform this question .\n",
        "Mycosis fungoides ( MF means Mycosis fungoides ) , the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas , generally has a favorable clinical course . Early MF means Mycosis fungoides typically presents erythematous patches and/or plaques and lasts for many years without affecting the life expectancy . Only limited cases progress to develop skin tumors , with subsequent lymph nodes and rarely visceral organ involvement . One of the clinical problems in early MF means Mycosis fungoides is the difficulty in differentiating the disease from benign inflammatory disorders ( BIDs means benign inflammatory disorders ) , such as atopic dermatitis , chronic eczema , and psoriasis . In some MF means Mycosis fungoides cases , clinical and pathological findings are similar to those of BIDs means benign inflammatory disorders . However , the accurate diagnosis of early MF means Mycosis fungoides is quite important , as inappropriate treatment including immunosuppressants can cause unfavorable or even fatal outcomes . This article focuses on general methods and novel tools for diagnosis of early MF means Mycosis fungoides .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can arise during the first months of life or at maturity and have a significant negative impact on the quality of life . The main pathogenic mechanism is the breakdown of cutaneous barrier integrity , which is associated with systemic inflammatory immunologic disorders . Atopic dermatitis involves numerous immunologic , allergic , respiratory , and ophthalmologic comorbidities that develop through similar intricate pathogenic phenomena . The atopic march represents the evolution in time of various allergic diseases , of which food allergies often cause the first manifestations of atopy , even from a very young age . Chronic inflammation translated through specific markers , next to increased immunoglobulin E ( IgE means immunoglobulin E ) serum levels and heterogenous clinical manifestations , argue for the inclusion of atopic dermatitis in the systemic disease category .\n",
        "Dupilumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody , capable of inhibiting intracellular signaling of both interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 . These are two molecules that , together with other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-5 and eotaxins , play a pivotal role in orchestrating the airway inflammatory response defined as Type 2 ( T2 means Type 2 ) inflammation , driven by Th2 or Type 2 innate lymphoid cells , which is the major feature of the T2 means Type 2 high asthma phenotype . The dual inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 activities is due to the blockade of type II IL-4 receptor through the binding of dupilumab with the subunit IL-4Rα . This results in the repression of STAT6 and in the suppression of subsequent de novo formation of several molecules involved in the T2 means Type 2 inflammatory signature . Several clinical trials tested the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in large populations of uncontrolled severe asthmatics , revealing significant improvements in lung function , asthma control , and exacerbation rate . Similar results were reported when dupilumab was employed in patients harboring pathogenetic processes related to T2 means Type 2 immune response , such as atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinosinusitis . In this review , we provide an overview of the recent research in the field of respiratory medicine about dupilumab mechanism of action and its effects .\n",
        "Ceramides play an essential role in forming a permeability barrier in the skin . Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common chronic skin disease associated with skin barrier dysfunction and immunological abnormalities . In patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , the amount and composition of ceramides in the stratum corneum are altered . This suggests that ceramide abnormalities are involved in the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis . The mechanism underlying lipid abnormalities in AD means Atopic dermatitis has not yet been fully elucidated , but the involvement of Th2 and Th1 cytokines is implicated . Ceramide-dominant emollients have beneficial effects on skin barrier function ; thus , they have been approved as an adjunctive barrier repair agent for AD means Atopic dermatitis . This review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms of ceramide abnormalities in AD means Atopic dermatitis . Furthermore , the potential therapeutic approaches for correcting ceramide abnormalities in AD means Atopic dermatitis are discussed .\n",
        "General inflammatory diseases include skin inflammation , rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel diseases , sepsis , arteriosclerosis , and asthma . Although these diseases have been extensively studied , most of them are still difficult to treat . Meanwhile , NF-κB is a transcription factor promoting the expression of many inflammatory mediators . NF-κB is likely to be involved in the mechanism of most inflammatory diseases . We discovered a specific NF-κB inhibitor , dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin ( DHMEQ means dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin ) , about 20 years ago by molecular design from a natural product . It directly binds to and inactivates NF-κB components . It has been widely used to suppress cellular and animal inflammatory disease models and was shown to be potent in vivo anti-inflammatory activity without any toxicity . We have prepared ointment of DHMEQ means dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin for the treatment of severe skin inflammation . It inhibited inflammatory cytokine expressions and lowered the clinical score in mouse models of atopic dermatitis . Intraperitoneal ( IP means Intraperitoneal ) administration of DHMEQ means dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin ameliorated various disease models of inflammation , such as rheumatoid arthritis , sepsis , and also graft rejection . It has been suggested that inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity would be important for most peripheral inflammation . In the present review , we describe the synthesis , mechanism of action , and cellular and in vivo anti-inflammatory activities and discuss the clinical use of DHMEQ means dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin for inflammatory diseases .\n",
        "Evidence suggests adults with atopic eczema have increased fracture risk . However , it is unclear whether oral corticosteroids explain the association . To assess to what extent oral corticosteroids mediate the relationship between atopic eczema and fractures . We conducted a cohort study using English primary care means Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( Clinical Practice Research Datalink ) and hospital admissions ( Hospital Episode Statistics ) records ( 1998 - 2016 ) including adults ( 18 + ) with atopic eczema matched ( age , sex , and general practice ) with up to five adults without atopic eczema . We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs means hazard ratios ) for specific major osteoporotic fractures ( hip , spine , pelvis , wrist ) and for any-site fracture comparing individuals with atopic eczema to those without , adjusting for six different definitions of time-updated oral corticosteroid use ( ever any prescription , ever high dose , and recent , cumulative , current or peak dose ) . We identified 526,808 individuals with atopic eczema and 2,569,030 without . We saw evidence of an association between atopic eczema and major osteoporotic fractures ( e.g. , spine HR 1.15 99%CI 1.08 - 1.22 ; hip HR 1.11 99%CI 1.08 - 1.15 ) that remained after additionally adjusting for oral corticosteroids ( e.g. , cumulative corticosteroid dose : spine HR 1.09 99%CI 1.03 - 1.16 ; hip HR 1.09 99%CI 1.06 - 1.12 ) . Fracture rates were higher in people with severe atopic eczema compared to people without even after adjusting for oral corticosteroids ( e.g. , spine HR [ 99%CI ] : confounder adjusted 2.31 [ 1.91 - 2.81 ] ; additionally adjusted for cumulative dose 1.71 [ 1.40 - 2.09 ] ) . Our findings suggest that little of the association between atopic eczema and major osteoporotic fractures is explained by oral corticosteroid use .\n",
        "The olfactory nuisance , due to the emissions of active molecules , is mainly associated with unproperly managed waste disposal and animal farming . Volatile compounds e.g. , aromatics , organic and inorganic sulfide compounds , as well as nitrogen and halogenated compounds are the major contributor to odor pollution generated by waste management plants ; the most important source of atmospheric ammonia is produced by livestock farming . Although an odorous compound may represent a nuisance rather than a health risk , long-term exposure to a mixture of volatile compounds may represent a risk for different diseases , including asthma , atopic dermatitis , and neurologic damage . Workers and communities living close to odor-producing facilities result directly exposed to irritant air pollutants through inhalation and for this reason the cumulative health risk assessment is recommended . Health effects are related to the concentration and exposure duration to the odorants , as well as to their irritant potency and/or biotransformation in hazardous metabolites . The health effects of a single chemical are well known , while the interactions between molecules with different functional groups have still to be extensively studied . Odor emissions are often due to airborne pollutants at levels below the established toxicity thresholds . The relationship between odor and toxicity does not always occurs but depends on the specific kind of pollutant involved . Indeed , some toxic agents does not induce odor nuisance while untoxic agents do . Accordingly , the relationship between toxicity and odor nuisance should be always analyzed in detail evaluating on the characteristics of the airborne mixture and the type of the source involved .\n",
        "Ethylhexylglycerin ( EHG means Ethylhexylglycerin ) is a recently recognized contact allergen . The aims of the study were to characterize individuals with positive patch test reactions to EHG means Ethylhexylglycerin and to analyze reaction strength , clinical relevance , and allergen sources . This study was a retrospective analysis of the patients patch tested to EHG means Ethylhexylglycerin ( 5 % petrolatum ) by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group ( 2013 - 2018 ) . Of 15,560 patients tested to EHG means Ethylhexylglycerin , 39 ( 0.25 % ) had positive ( final interpretation of \" allergic \" ) reactions . Most were female ( 71.8 % ) and/or older than 40 years ( 76.9 % ) . There were no statistically significant differences between age , sex , or atopic history when compared with EHG-negative patients . The most common anatomic sites of dermatitis were the face ( 28.2 % ) and scattered generalized distribution ( 25.6 % ) . Most EHG-positive reactions were + ( 35.9 % ) or + + ( 33.3 % ) . Current clinical relevance was high ( 79.5 % ) ; none , however , were related to occupation . Personal care products were the most common source of exposure to EHG means Ethylhexylglycerin ( 59.0 % ) . Ethylhexylglycerin is a rare contact allergen ; the positive frequency of 0.25 % is similar to other low allergenic preservatives including parabens , benzyl alcohol , and phenoxyethanol . The patch test concentration of 5.0 % seems to be nonirritating . Although relatively uncommon , EHG means Ethylhexylglycerin reactions were usually clinically relevant ( 79.5 % ) , often because of moisturizers/lotions/creams .\n",
        "Although bullous pemphigoid ( BP means bullous pemphigoid ) , atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , and allergic rhinitis ( AR means allergic rhinitis ) are associated with shared pathogenic mechanisms the epidemiological relationship between these conditions remains to be investigated . To evaluate the bidirectional association of BP means bullous pemphigoid with AD means atopic dermatitis and AR means allergic rhinitis . A population-based retrospective cohort study was performed comparing BP means bullous pemphigoid patients ( n = 3924 ) with age- , sex- , and ethnicity-matched control subjects ( n = 19,280 ) , with respect to incident cases of AD means atopic dermatitis and AR means allergic rhinitis . A case-control design was additionally adopted to assess the odds of BP means bullous pemphigoid in individuals with a preexisting diagnosis of AD means atopic dermatitis and AR means allergic rhinitis . The odds of BP means bullous pemphigoid was increased after a preexisting diagnosis of AD means atopic dermatitis ( fully adjusted odds ratio , 1.76 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.44 - 2.15 ; P & lt ; 0.001 ) and AR means allergic rhinitis ( fully adjusted odds ratio , 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.28 ; P = 0.047 ) . Patients with BP means bullous pemphigoid were at an increased risk of subsequent AD means atopic dermatitis ( fully adjusted hazard ratio , 2.00 ; 95 % CI , 1.60 - 2.51 ; P & lt ; 0.001 ) but not AR means allergic rhinitis ( fully adjusted hazard ratio , 1.00 ; 95 % CI , 0.83 - 1.20 ; P = 0.997 ) . Compared with other patients with BP means bullous pemphigoid , those with BP means bullous pemphigoid and comorbid AD means atopic dermatitis and AR means allergic rhinitis were more frequently managed by adjuvant drugs and long-term systemic and topical corticosteroids and had decreased all-cause mortality . A history of AD means atopic dermatitis and AR means allergic rhinitis confers susceptibility to the development of BP means bullous pemphigoid . Awareness of this association may be of help for physicians managing patients with these diseases .\n",
        "The management required for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) may worsen patient burden , thereby resulting in iatrogenic burden , that is , morbidity caused by medical treatment . We sought to describe the iatrogenic burden of AD means atopic dermatitis and conducted a narrative review of key areas that clinicians can address to minimize it . Clinicians should think strategically about itch trigger avoidance , encourage slow incorporation of lifestyle changes , and emphasize step-up therapy when avoidance becomes too burdensome . Out-of-pocket treatment costs should be incorporated into shared decision making to balance affordability , preference , efficacy , and safety . Polypharmacy should be minimized by eliminating ineffective , nonevidence-based , and redundant therapies while appropriately stepping up to advanced therapy . Clinicians should take adequate time to communicate , the impact of AD means atopic dermatitis on quality of life , and incorporate evidence-based guidelines . The multidimensional nature of AD means atopic dermatitis requires a dynamic approach . Future guidelines should incorporate step-up , step-down , and maintenance approaches to reduce treatment burden and improve quality of life .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic skin disease that may be triggered by psychological conditions and several allergens . Patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis may be experienced disease exacerbation due to the COVID-19 pandemic lifestyle including home-quarantine and increased stress . We obtained the electronic data of 100 AD means Atopic dermatitis patients admitted to our hospital from 2016 to 2019 and called them with specific phone line . Out of 100 patients , 43 were male , and 57 were female ( mean age < i>±SD : 45.85±16.90</i > ) . Sixty patients ( 37 females and 23males ; mean age : 42.22±14.71 ) confronted disease flare-up during the COVID-19 era . Exacerbation of AD means Atopic dermatitis was correlated with treatment dose alteration , a lengthy history of atopic dermatitis , eczema duration , self-isolation , frequent handwashing , hand disinfection , and POEM scoring ( P&lt;0.05 ) . Regarding the POEM scoring , 61 patients with moderate to severe AD means Atopic dermatitis experienced higher anxiety than 39 patients with silent to mild AD means Atopic dermatitis (p=0.013).In this study , most patients experienced disease exacerbation and perceived mild anxiety in this pandemic .\n",
        "Dysfunctional autophagy is linked to various diseases , including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . Recent evidence suggests that exposure of keratinocytes to TNF-α results in impaired autophagy and lysosomal function . The skin of patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis reveals a decreased expression of lysosomal cathepsins . Impaired autophagy is presumably involved in inflammation and disturbed keratinocyte differentiation , whereas stimulating autophagy might be a treatment option in inflammatory skin disease .\n",
        "While a plethora of literature continues to be published on the role of nutritional agents both in lay press and indexed journals , the data is not on a firm footing and leaves the dermatologist in a quandry and the patient confused . The various agents include vitamins , minerals , amino acids , antioxidants , diets & amp ; gluten . A proper knowledge of the role of nutritional supplements in dermatological diseases can be a useful tool in advising the patients and in certain cases ameliorating the disorder . Literature review of last 15 years was made using the terms \" diet in dermatology , \" \" nutrition and skin , \" \" nutritional supplements in dermatology , \" \" nutritional agents and acne , \" \" nutritional agents and alopecia , \" and \" nutritional agents and psoriasis . \" While there are multiple publications on the use of nutritional supplements for amelioration of skin diseases , most of them are based on either associations or in vitro studies , but very few transcend the rigors of a clinical trial or the holey grail of a double-blinded randomized controlled trial . There seem to be some evidence in acne , psoriasis , telogen effluvium , urticaria & amp ; vitiligo . Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis have a strong link with diet . Rosacea has a strong link with certain foods , but the other disorders like melasma , aphthous stomatitis do not have any scientifically validated association with diet . Our updated review examines the role of nutritional supplements and antioxidants in various dermatological disorders . We have found that there are varying levels of evidence with notable associations of low glycemic diet & amp ; acne , fish oil & amp ; weight loss with psoriasis , fish oils & amp ; probiotics with atopic dermatitis & amp ; vitamins & amp ; botanical extracts with vitiligo . The evidence for diet and nutrition in bullous disorders and photoageing is scarce . The role of low histamine diet in urticaria is useful in select cases of episodic urticaria . Rosacea is triggered by hot and spicy food . Apart from gluten and Dermatitis Herpetiformis , no diet can be considered disease modifying in our reveiw . The lack of comparison of nutritional or dietary modiffication with conventional validated agents , makes the data difficult to translate in real world patient management .\n",
        "In a population-based birth cohort , we aimed to identify longitudinal trajectories of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) during childhood using data from different sources ( validated questionnaires and healthcare records ) , investigate impact of different AD means atopic dermatitis definitions on such trajectories and their relationships with various risk factors . Of the 1184 children born into the study , 1083 had information on current AD means atopic dermatitis on at least three follow-ups from birth to age 11 years and were included in the analysis for parentally-reported AD means atopic dermatitis ( PRAD means parentally-reported AD ) . Data were transcribed from healthcare records of 916/1184 children , for the analysis of doctor-diagnosed AD means atopic dermatitis ( DDAD means doctor-diagnosed AD ) . We also derived composite definition ( CDAD ; at least 2 of 3 features : PRAD means parentally-reported AD , DDAD means doctor-diagnosed AD , current use of AD means atopic dermatitis treatment ) . Using latent class analysis ( LCA means latent class analysis ) , we determined longitudinal profiles of AD means atopic dermatitis using the three definitions ( PRAD means parentally-reported AD , DDAD means doctor-diagnosed AD CDAD ) . FLG genotype was available for 803 Caucasian participants . For PRAD means parentally-reported AD , LCA means latent class analysis identified four AD means atopic dermatitis classes ( \" No AD means atopic dermatitis \" , \" Persistent \" , \" Early-onset remitting \" \" and \" Late-onset \" ) . For DDAD means doctor-diagnosed AD and CDAD , the optimal number of phenotypes was three ( \" No AD means atopic dermatitis \" , \" Persistent \" and \" Early-onset remitting \" ) . Although AD means atopic dermatitis classes at population level appeared similar in different models , a considerable proportion of children ( n=485 , 45 % ) moved between classes . The association with FLG genotype , atopic diseases , and early-life risk factors were inconsistent across different definitions , but the association with oral food challenge-confirmed peanut allergy was similar , with a 9 to 11-fold increase amongst children in the Persistent AD means atopic dermatitis class . In a CDAD model , compared to Early-onset remitting class , those with Persistent AD means atopic dermatitis were significantly more likely to have ( at age 3 years ) moderate/severe AD means atopic dermatitis ( OR=11.6 , [ 95 % CI 1.7 - 80.2 ] ) , polysensitisation ( 5.2 , [ 1.3 - 21.2 ] ) , and current wheeze ( 4.8 , [ 1.4 - 16.6 ] ) , and were less likely to be breastfed ( 0.2 , [ 0.05 - 0.8 ] ) . Standardised composite definitions of AD means atopic dermatitis may help define AD means atopic dermatitis cases with more precision and identify more consistent long-term trajectories .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease and presents a major public health burden worldwide . Recent observational studies revealed the potential association between atopic dermatitis with autoimmune disorders . However , there is no meta-analysis of the prevalence or incidence of autoimmune diseases in atopic dermatitis . Therefore , considering the potential clinical implications of these associations , we aimed to assess the risk of autoimmune diseases in patients with atopic dermatitis using this method . PubMed , Embase , and Web of Science were searched from inception to October , 2020 . Observational studies which provided estimate effects with 95 % CI or raw data were included . The quality of selected studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale . Odds ratio and relative risks were pooled using a random effects model and expressed with 95 % confidence intervals . Fourteen observational studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis . The random-effects meta-analysis of case-control and cross-sectional studies showed a significant association of atopic dermatitis with mutiple autoimmune diseases , including alopecia areata , celiac disease , Crohn 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systematic lupus erythematosus , ulcerative colitis and vitiligo . Furthermore , pooling of the results of cohort studies showed that patients with atopic dermatitis were more likely to develop these autoimmune diseases . Our meta-analysis showed that patients with atopic dermatitis were at higher risk of multiple autoimmune diseases including alopecia areata , celiac disease , Crohn 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systematic lupus erythematosus , ulcerative colitis and vitiligo . It is important for early detection of the affected group so that timely management can be initiated . Dermatologists and allergists should be aware of the autoimmune diseases in patients with atopic dermatitis and develop interventions if necessary . Also , limited by the present research , we still require more large-scale studies to further establish the association between atopic dermatitis and autoimmune diseases .\n",
        "The immunopathogenic role of house dust mite ( HDM means house dust mite ) allergens in the development of skin lesions in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) has not yet been precisely clarified . We immunohistopathologically evaluated the localization of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-positive epidermal dendritic cells means cells with HDM means house dust mite antigens in the skin lesions of patients with IgE-allergic AD means atopic dermatitis . Using double-immunofluorescence and single-immunochemical staining methods , we analyzed biopsy specimens from the skin lesions of six patients with IgE-allergic AD means atopic dermatitis and HDM means house dust mite allergy and 11 control subjects with inflammatory skin disorders . Inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells means cells ( IDECs ; CD11c+ and CD206 + cells means cells ) were markedly observed in the central area of the spongiotic epidermis of skin lesions in all AD means atopic dermatitis patients . Furthermore , IgE-positive IDECs with HDM means house dust mite antigens in the central areas of the spongiosis were found in four of the six ( 66.7 % ) AD means atopic dermatitis patients . Langerhans cells means cells ( LCs ; CD207 + cells means cells ) with HDM means house dust mite antigens were also observed in the peripheral areas of the spongiosis . Infiltration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells means cells in association with IgE-positive IDECs and LCs with HDM means house dust mite antigens was seen in the spongiotic epidermis . An IgE-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction , in combination with IgE-bearing dendritic cells means cells , specific T cells means cells , keratinocytes , and HDM means house dust mite antigens , may lead to spongiotic tissue formation in eczematous dermatitis in AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Skin barrier dysfunction can lead to water and electrolyte loss , triggering homeostatic imbalances that can trigger atopic dermatitis and anaphylaxis . Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb with known therapeutic benefits for the treatment of skin diseases , including photodamage repair effects and reduction of pigmentation . However , few reports exist that describe effectiveness of ginseng active components for repair of skin barrier damage . Ginseng oligosaccharide extract ( GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract ) was prepared from P. ginseng via water extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resin and gel purification . GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract composition and structural characteristics were determined using LC-MS , HPLC , FT-IR , and NMR . To evaluate GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract as a skin barrier repair-promoting treatment , skin of UVB-irradiated BALB/c hairless mice was treated with or without GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract then skin samples were evaluated for epidermal thickness , transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) , and stratum corneum water content . In addition , UVB-exposed skin samples and HaCaT cells were analyzed to assess GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract treatment effects on levels of epidermal cornified envelope ( CE means cornified envelope ) protein and other skin barrier proteins , such as filaggrin ( FLG means filaggrin ) , involucrin ( IVL means involucrin ) , and aquaporin-3 ( AQP3 means aquaporin-3 ) . Meanwhile , GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract treatment was also evaluated for effects on UVB-irradiated hairless mouse skin and HaCaT cells based on levels of serine protease inhibitor Kazal type-5 ( SPINK5 means serine protease inhibitor Kazal type-5 ) , trypsin-like kallikrein-related peptidase 5 ( KLK5 means kallikrein-related peptidase 5 ) , chymotrypsin-like KLK7 , and desmoglein 1 ( DSG1 means desmoglein 1 ) . These proteins are associated with UVB-induced skin barrier damage manifesting as dryness and desquamation . GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract was shown to consist of oligosaccharides comprised of seven distinct types of monosaccharides with molecular weights of approximately 1 kDa that were covalently linked together via β-glycosidic bonds . In vivo , GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract applied to dorsal skin of BALB/c hairless mice attenuated UVB-induced epidermal thickening and moisture loss . Furthermore , GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract ameliorated UVB-induced reductions of levels of FLG means filaggrin , IVL means involucrin , and AQP3 means aquaporin-3 proteins . Additionally , GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract treatment led to increased DSG1 means desmoglein 1 protein levels due to decreased expression of KLK7 . In vitro , GSO means Ginseng oligosaccharide extract treatment of UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells led to increases of FLG means filaggrin , IVL means involucrin , and AQP3 means aquaporin-3 mRNA levels and corresponding proteins , while mRNA levels of desquamation-related proteins SPINK5 means serine protease inhibitor Kazal type-5 , KLK5 means kallikrein-related peptidase 5 , KLK7 , and DSG1 means desmoglein 1 and associated protein levels were restored to normal levels . A P. ginseng oligosaccharide preparation repaired UVB-induced skin barrier damage by alleviating skin dryness and desquamation symptoms , highlighting its potential as a natural cosmetic additive that can promote skin barrier repair after UVB exposure .\n",
        "Different aspects of quality of life ( QoL means quality of life ) of infants and children with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) are well studied but there is a lack of studies on seborrhoeic dermatitis ( SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis ) and allergic contact dermatitis ( ACD means allergic contact dermatitis ) . The aim of this study was to compare the impact of SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis , ACD means allergic contact dermatitis and AD means atopic dermatitis on young children . Parts of questionnaires were filled in during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore we decided to check if the pandemic affected dermatology-specific health-related quality of life ( HRQoL means health-related quality of life ) in our patients . In this cross-sectional study approved by the local ethics committee of the Kiev City Clinical Dermatovenereologic Hospital parents of children with SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis , ACD means allergic contact dermatitis and AD means atopic dermatitis from birth to 4 years old from the same department of dermatology were asked to fill in the dermatology-specific questionnaire the Infants and Toddlers Dermatology Quality of Life ( InToDermQoL ) . Diagnoses were based on clinical manifestations and anamnesis . The study was carried out from 2018 till 2021 . The InToDermQoL questionnaire was filled in by 176 parents of children with SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis , ACD means allergic contact dermatitis and AD means atopic dermatitis . Mean total InToDermQoL scores were significantly higher in children with AD means atopic dermatitis than in SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis and ACD means allergic contact dermatitis ( P & lt ; 0.01 ) . HRQoL means health-related quality of life of children with AD means atopic dermatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly worse than before pandemic ( 41.30 ± 24.40 and 28.51 ± 17.67 respectively , P = 0.02 ) . Scores of the item on ' sleep problems ' significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in children with SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis ( 1.19 ± 1.01 and 0.64 ± 0.63 , P & lt ; 0.05 ) , as did scores of the item on ' rejection by other children ' in children with AD means atopic dermatitis ( 0.96 ± 0.98 and 0.20 ± 0.45 , P & lt ; 0.05 ) . To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on HRQoL means health-related quality of life of the youngest children with SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis and ACD means allergic contact dermatitis . In our study children with SD means seborrhoeic dermatitis and ACD means allergic contact dermatitis had comparable but lower impact of skin disease on their HRQoL means health-related quality of life than children with AD means atopic dermatitis . The COVID-19 pandemic led to more severe HRQoL means health-related quality of life impairment in patients with AD means atopic dermatitis visiting a dermatology department .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions . Interleukin (IL)-33 , a cytokine of the IL-1 family , was found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis . As a key component of the inflammasome , NLRP3 has been mostly described in myeloid cells that to mediate inflammasome activation conducted proinflammatory cytokine production of the IL-1 family . However , the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis , as well as IL-33 processing are highly controversial . Whether NLRP3 can mediate IL-33 expression and secretion independently of the inflammasome in the epithelium of AD means Atopic dermatitis has remained unclear . In this article , we found the mRNA expression of Il33 and Nlrp3 were notably increased in the lesional skin of AD means Atopic dermatitis patients compared to healthy controls . We then found a significant positive correlation between the expression of Nlrp3 and Il33 in the epithelium of MC903-mediated AD means Atopic dermatitis mice model , but no changes were observed for Il36α , Il36γ , Il1β , or Il18 mRNA expression , as well as IL-1β or IL-18 production . Overexpression of NLRP3 in human immortalized epithelial cells increased IL-33 expression , whereas siRNA targeting NLRP3 abolished IL-33 expression . In addition , inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation or caspase-1 activity with MCC950 or VX-765 showed no effect on the expression and secretion of IL-33 in AD means Atopic dermatitis mice . Unlike myeloid cells , NLRP3 predominantly located in the nucleus of epithelial cells , which could directly bind to Il33 specific-promoters and transactivate it through an interaction with transcription factor IRF4 . Furthermore , NLRP3 deficient mice exhibited a significant alleviated epidermis inflammation and decreased mRNA expression and secretion of IL-33 in MC903-mediated AD means Atopic dermatitis mice without interfering with TSLP and IL-1β production . Our results demonstrate a novel ability of NLRP3 to function as a crucial transcription factor of IL-33 in epithelium independently of inflammasome that to mediate the pathological process of AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Aberrant epidermal differentiation is a hallmark of inflammatory skin diseases , including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . If and how differentiated epidermal cells contribute to inflammatory pathology is unclear . In their new article in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology , Shao et al.

        "Hydroxyzine HCL ( HHCL means Hydroxyzine HCL ) is an antihistamine , used for the treatment of allergic skin conditions . The purpose of this study was to achieve a dual phase drug delivery rate across the intact skin , to enhance HHCL means Hydroxyzine HCL permeation through the stratum corneum , to assess the peripheral H < sub>1</sub>-antihistaminic activity and the extent to which HHCL means Hydroxyzine HCL was systemically absorbed from transdermal gel loaded with solid lipid nanoparticles ( SLNs means solid lipid nanoparticles ) , as well as to avoid its extreme bitterness . According to 2<sup>3</sup > factorial design , eight formulations of HHCL-SLNs were prepared by the double emulsification method . Lipid type ( X < sub > A</sub > ) , surfactant concentration ( X < sub > B</sub > ) and co-surfactant concentration ( X < sub > C</sub > ) were the independent variables . All formulations were characterized for their surface morphology , particle size , entrapment efficiency and in-vitro drug release study . The optimized formula that provides greater desirability was then incorporated into the transdermal gel . In addition , the efficacy of the developed gel was tested in-vivo using 2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene induced atopic dermatitis as lesion model in mice . F4 showed an average diameter 111 nm ± 0.03 , zeta potential - 30 MV ± 2.4 and EE 75.2 % ± 4.4 . TEM images showed spherical , smooth morphology with uniform particles distribution . In-vivo study demonstrated potent antipruritic efficacy of transdermal gel in atopic dermatitis such as induced lesions compared to HHCL means Hydroxyzine HCL gel . Hence , HHCL means Hydroxyzine HCL solid lipid nanoparticles transdermal gel may be considered as potential for delivery of HHCL means Hydroxyzine HCL and alternatively to traditional oral use .\n",
        "Allergic disorders target a young population , are increasing in both incidence and prevalence and are associated with significant disease burden . They result from the complex interplay between (epi)genetic and environmental factors , resulting in a Th2 inflammatory process targeting the epithelium of the respiratory tract ( allergic rhinitis and asthma ) , skin ( atopic dermatitis ) , and gastrointestinal tract ( food allergy ) . Although the exact pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive , an altered immune system response in the gut is increasingly recognized as a relevant step . Allergic and gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders share several epidemiological , pathogenic and risk factors and several treatment modalities . Here we revise the current literature and show that allergic disorders are highly prevalent in gastrointestinal autoimmune diseases , including celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease , autoimmune pancreatitis , and autoimmune cholangiopathies . No data are available for some autoimmune diseases , such as autoimmune gastritis and autoimmune enteropathy . To ensure the comprehensive care of patients with autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders , along with disease-specific factors , the presence of allergic disorders should be evaluated and treated when present , possibly targeting shared molecular pathways . Future studies are needed to define the exact pathogenic mechanisms underpinning the association between allergic and autoimmune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract .\n",
        "Chronic pruritus , or itch , is common and debilitating , but the neuro-immune mechanisms that drive chronic itch are only starting to be elucidated . Recent studies demonstrate that the IL-33 receptor ( IL-33R means IL-33 receptor ) is expressed by sensory neurons . However , whether sensory neuron-restricted activity of IL-33 is necessary for chronic itch remains poorly understood . We sought to determine if IL-33 signaling in sensory neurons is critical for the development of chronic itch in two divergent pruritic disease models . Plasma levels of IL-33 were assessed in patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and chronic pruritus of unknown origin ( CPUO means chronic pruritus of unknown origin ) . Mice were generated to conditionally delete IL-33R means IL-33 receptor from sensory neurons . The contribution of neuronal IL-33R means IL-33 receptor signaling to chronic itch development was tested in mouse models that recapitulate key pathologic features of AD means atopic dermatitis and CPUO means chronic pruritus of unknown origin , respectively . IL-33 was elevated in both AD means atopic dermatitis and CPUO means chronic pruritus of unknown origin as well as their respective mouse models . While neuron-restricted IL-33R means IL-33 receptor signaling was dispensable for itch in AD-like disease , it was required for the development of dry skin itch in a mouse model that mirrors key aspects of CPUO means chronic pruritus of unknown origin pathology . These data highlight how IL-33 may be a predominant mediator of itch in certain contexts , depending on the tissue microenvironment . Further , this study provides insight for future therapeutic strategies targeting the IL-33 pathway for chronic itch .\n",
        "MALT1-deficiency is a rare combined immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent infections , dermatitis and enteropathy . We herein investigate the immunological profiles of our patient and previously reported children with MALT1-deficiency . A mutation analysis was performed by targeted panel sequencing for primary immunodeficiency . Lymphocyte subset , activation and B cell differentiation were analyzed by flow-cytometry and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding . Pneumocystis pneumonia developed in a 6-month-old Japanese infant with atopic dermatitis , enteritis and growth restriction . This infant showed agammaglobulinemia without lymphopenia . At 8 years of age , the genetic diagnosis of MALT1-deficiency was confirmed on a novel homozygous mutation of c.1102G&gt;T , p. E368X . T-cell stimulation tests showed impairments in the production of interleukin-2 , phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 , and differentiation of B cells . In combination with the literature data , we found that the number of circulatory B cells , but not T cells , were inversely correlated with the age of patients . The hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT means hematopoietic cell transplantation ) successfully reconstituted the differentiation of mature B cells and T cells . These data conceptualize that patients with complete MALT1-deficiency show aberrant differentiation and depletion of B cells . The early diagnosis and HCT means hematopoietic cell transplantation lead to a cure of the disease phenotype associated with the loss-of-function mutations in human CARD11 .\n",
        "Early exposure to allergens through a defect skin barrier has been proposed as a mechanism for inducing sensitization and development of allergic diseases . We hypothesized that early-onset , severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) is associated with development of aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis . We included 368 children from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood < sub>2000</sub > ( COPSAC < sub>2000</sub > ) at-risk mother-child cohort . AD means atopic dermatitis was diagnosed prospectively based on Hanifin&amp;Rajka 's criteria and severity assessed using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD means Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ) index . Early-onset AD means atopic dermatitis was defined as debut ≤1 year , late-onset as debut from 1 - 6 years . Aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis were diagnosed at ages 6 - 7 and 12 years . Associations between early-onset and late-onset AD means atopic dermatitis and allergy endpoints were calculated using general estimating equations ( GEE means general estimating equations ) models to compute the overall odds ratios ( OR means odds ratios ) for both time points . Early-onset AD means atopic dermatitis ( yes/no ) and severity ( SCORAD means Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ) were associated with development of aeroallergen sensitization during childhood ; GEE means general estimating equations OR=1.68 [ 1.08 ; 2.62 ] , p=0.02 and 1.08 [ 1.03 ; 1.12 ] , p&lt;0.001 , whereas late-onset AD means atopic dermatitis showed a borderline significant association and late-onset severity showed no association ; GEE means general estimating equations OR=1.65 [ 0.92 ; 2.94 ] , p=0.08 and 1.01 [ 0.97 ; 1.06 ] , p=0.55 . The same trend was seen for allergic rhinitis with significant association between early-onset AD means atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis ; GEE means general estimating equations OR=1.56 [ 1.01 ; 2.41 ] , p=0.04 and severity ; GEE means general estimating equations OR=1.09 [ 1.05 ; 1.13 ] , p&lt;0.001 , whereas late-onset AD means atopic dermatitis showed no association . The effects on sensitization and rhinitis of early-onset vs. late-onset AD means atopic dermatitis severity were significantly different : p-interaction < sub > sensitization</sub > = 0.03 and p-interaction < sub > rhinitis</sub > & lt;0.01 . Increasing severity of early-onset AD means atopic dermatitis , but not late-onset AD means atopic dermatitis , associates with aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis later in childhood .\n",
        "Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 means Interleukin-4 ) is a four-α-helical bundle type I cytokine with broad pleiotropic actions on multiple lineages . Major actions of IL-4 means Interleukin-4 were initially discovered for B and T cells , but this cytokine acts on more than a dozen different target cells spanning the innate and adaptive immune systems and is produced by multiple different cellular sources . While IL-4 means Interleukin-4 was discovered just under 40 years ago in 1982 , the interest in and discoveries related to this cytokine continue to markedly expand . There are important new advances related to its biological actions and to its mechanisms of signaling , including critical genes and downstream targets in a range of cell types . IL-4 means Interleukin-4 is critical not only for careful control of immunoglobulin production but also related to inflammation , fibrosis , allergic reactions , and antitumor activity , with actions of IL-4 means Interleukin-4 occurring through two different types of receptors , one of which is also used by IL-13 , a closely related cytokine with partially overlapping actions . In this review , we cover critical older information but also highlight newer advances . An area of evolving interest relates to the therapeutic blockade of IL-4 means Interleukin-4 signaling pathway to treat atopic dermatitis and asthma . Thus , this cytokine is historically important , and research in this area has both elucidated major biological pathways and led to therapeutic advances for diseases that affect millions of individuals .\n",
        "Using a lung sound analysis , the prognosis of asthma was investigated in infants with risk factors for asthma development by a long-term observation . A total of 268 infants were included ( median age : 8 months old ) . The lung sound parameters ( the ratio of the third and fourth area to the total area under the curve [ A < sub>3</sub>/A < sub > T</sub > and B < sub>4</sub>/A < sub > T</sub > ] , and the ratio of power and frequency at 50 % and 75 % of the highest frequency [ RPF < sub>50</sub > and RPF < sub>75</sub > ] ) were evaluated at the first visit . At 3 years old , using a questionnaire , we examined the relationship between the lung sound parameters and risk factors of asthma development . Among the 268 infants , 175 infants were in good health and 93 had a history of acute respiratory infection ( ARI means acute respiratory infection ) within 7 days at the first visit . Among the 3- to 12-month-old infants with an ARI means acute respiratory infection , the A < sub>3</sub>/A < sub > T</sub > , B < sub>4</sub>/A < sub > T</sub > values in those with a history of asthma/asthmatic bronchitis , atopic dermatitis , and atopy were smaller than in the infants without such histories .

The characteristics of the lung sounds in infants with risk factors for asthma development were demonstrated over long-term follow-up . Lung sound analyses may be useful for assessing the airway condition of infants .\n",
        "Celiac disease ( CD means Celiac disease ) is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten proteins and is often characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms . Food allergy ( FA means Food allergy ) is an adverse immune sensitivity to ingested food proteins leading to inflammation in various organs including the gastrointestinal tract . The relationship between CD means Celiac disease and FA means Food allergy remains unclear . This study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical relevance of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food sensitization in children with CD means Celiac disease . Fifty-nine children diagnosed with CD means Celiac disease were reviewed for clinical symptoms and evidence of IgE-sensitization to food and airborne allergens using the PolyCheck method . IgE-mediated sensitization has been diagnosed in 20.3 % of children with CD means Celiac disease ( CD/ A ) . In the CD/A group , 58.3 % of children were sensitized to food and 66.7 % to airborne allergens . Further , 41.7 % of patients with CD means Celiac disease and allergy reported gastrointestinal tract symptoms associated with the ingestion of sensitizing foods . Analysis of the clinical status revealed that the incidence of other allergic disorders in the CD/A group was as follows : atopic dermatitis ( 33.3 % ) , asthma ( 25.0 % ) , and allergic rhinitis ( 16.7 % ) . The percentage of eosinophils was significantly higher in the CD/A group than in the CD means Celiac disease group ( 0.33±0.25 vs. 0.11±0.09 ; < i > p</i>=0.006 ) . The diagnosis of CD means Celiac disease does not exclude FA means Food allergy . The gastrointestinal symptoms in children with CD means Celiac disease may be the result of both CD means Celiac disease and FA means Food allergy ; therefore , children with CD means Celiac disease should be evaluated for the presence of FA means Food allergy regardless of age .\n",

        "The pH of skin is critical for skin health and resilience and plays a key role in controlling the skin microbiome . It has been well reported that under dysbiotic conditions such as atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , eczema , etc . there are significant aberrations of skin pH , along with a higher level of < i > Staphylococcus aureus</i > compared to the commensal < i > Staphylococcus epidermidis</i > on skin . To understand the effect of pH on the relative growth of < i > S. epidermidis</i > and < i > S. aureus</i > , we carried out simple < i > in vitro</i > growth kinetic studies of the individual microbes under varying pH conditions . We demonstrated that the growth kinetics of < i > S. epidermidis</i > is relatively insensitive to pH within the range of 5 - 7 , while < i > S. aureus</i > shows a stronger pH dependence in that range . Gompertz 's model was used to fit the pH dependence of the growth kinetics of the two bacteria and showed that the equilibrium bacterial count of < i > S. aureus</i > was the more sensitive parameter . The switch in growth rate happens at a pH of 6.5 - 7 . Our studies are in line with the general hypothesis that keeping the skin pH within an acidic range is advantageous in terms of keeping the skin microbiome in balance and maintaining healthy skin .\n",
        "Interleukin-33 ( IL-33 ) is an epithelial-derived cytokine that plays an important role in immune-mediated diseases such as asthma , atopic dermatitis , and rheumatoid arthritis . Although IL-33 is considered a potential target for the treatment of allergy-related diseases , no small molecule that inhibits IL-33 has been reported . Based on the structure-activity relationship and in vitro 2D NMR studies employing < sup>15</sup > N-labeled IL-33 , we identified that the oxazolo[4,5-c]-quinolinone analog 7 c binds to the interface region of IL-33 and IL-33 receptor ( ST2 ) , an orphan receptor of the IL-1 receptor family . Compound 7 c effectively inhibited the production of IL-6 in human mast cells in a dose-dependent manner . Compound 7 c is the first low molecular weight IL-33 inhibitor and may be used as a prototype molecule for structural optimization and investigation of the IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway .\n",
        "It is well known that atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) is associated with other allergic diseases . Recentely , links to diseases other than allergic disease have also been actively studied . Among them , the results of studies regarding AD means atopic dermatitis comorbidities , especially cardiovascular disease ( CVD means cardiovascular disease ) , have varied from country to country . To analyze whether the risk of CVD means cardiovascular disease is different between AD means atopic dermatitis patients and healthy controls using Korean National Health Insurance Data . We obtained data from 2005 to 2016 from the Korean National Health Insurance Research Database . Patients with one AD means atopic dermatitis code and two AD-related tests codes were selected as AD means atopic dermatitis patients , and age-and sex-matched controls to the AD means atopic dermatitis patients were selected from among those without AD means atopic dermatitis ( 1:5 ) . Each group was investigated for accompanying metabolic syndrome ( which contains hypertension , type 2 diabetes , and hyperlipidemia ) and CVD means cardiovascular disease ( angina , myocardial infarction , peripheral vascular disease , and stroke ) using ICD 10 codes . The incidence of metabolic diseases and CVD means cardiovascular disease were significantly different between the AD means atopic dermatitis and control groups . Using multivariable Cox regression , differences were adjusted for sex , age , and other CVD means cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases . As a result , not only metabolic disease , but also the CVD means cardiovascular disease risk of AD means atopic dermatitis patients was significantly higher than that of the control group . Patients with AD means atopic dermatitis had as significantly higher risk of hyperlipidemia ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 33.02 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , hypertension ( HR = 4.86 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , and type 2 diabetes ( HR = 2.96 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) . AD means atopic dermatitis patients also had a higher risk of stroke ( HR = 10.61 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , myocardial infarction ( HR = 9.43 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , angina ( HR = 5.99 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , and peripheral vascular disease ( HR = 2.46 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) . Besides hyperlipidemia , there was no difference in risk according to AD means atopic dermatitis severity . Patients with AD means atopic dermatitis have a greater risk of CVD means cardiovascular disease than those without AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Microbial dysbiosis with increased Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus ) colonization on the skin is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , however most microbiome studies focus on bacteria in the flexures and the microbial composition at other body sites have not been studied systematically . The aim of the study is to characterize the skin microbiome , including bacteria , fungi and virus , at different body sites in relation to AD means atopic dermatitis , lesional state , and S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus colonization , and to test whether the nares could be a reservoir for S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus strain colonization . Using shotgun metagenomics we characterized microbial compositions from 14 well defined skin sites from 10 patients with AD means atopic dermatitis and 5 healthy controls . We found clear differences in microbial composition between AD means atopic dermatitis and controls at multiple skin sites , most pronounced on the flexures and neck . The flexures exhibited lower alpha-diversity and were colonized by S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus , accompanied by S. epidermidis in lesions . Malassezia species were absent on the neck in AD means atopic dermatitis . Virus mostly constituted Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus phages , with increased abundance of Propionibacterium phages PHL041 and PHL092 and Staphylococcus epidermidis phages CNPH82 and PH15 in AD means atopic dermatitis . In lesional samples , both the genus Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus phages were more abundant . S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus abundance was higher across all skin sites except from the feet . In samples where S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus was highly abundant , lower abundances of S. hominis and Cutibacterium acnes were observed . M. osloensis and M. luteus were more abundant in AD means atopic dermatitis . By single nucleotide variant analysis of S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus we found strains to be subject specific . On skin sites some S. aureus means Staphylococcus aureus aureus strains were similar and some dissimilar to the ones in the nares . Our data indicate a global and site-specific dysbiosis in AD means atopic dermatitis , involving both bacteria , fungus and virus . When defining targeted treatment clinicians should both consider the individual and skin site and future research into potential crosstalk between microbiota in AD means atopic dermatitis yields high potential .\n",
        "Many patients with chronic itch and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) or psoriasis do not receive/use available medical and psychosocial treatments properly due to system , provider , and/or patient factors . An educational website ( ITCH-RELIEF ) to improve itch-related quality of life ( QoL means quality of life ) for adults with AD means atopic dermatitis or psoriasis and chronic itch was developed and assessed . ITCH RELIEF stands for Interactive Toolbox of Comprehensive Health Resources to Enhance Living with Itch - Educational Facilitation ( for Adults ) . Single-arm pre- and post-test design with one-month follow up ( N = 137 at baseline ) . There was statistically and clinically significant improvement in the primary outcome of itch-related QoL means quality of life impairment as assessed by the ItchyQoL from baseline ( M=78.9 , 95 % CI = 75.9 , 81.9 ) to follow up ( M=75.4 , CI = 72.4 , 78.5 ) , p=0.007 , as well as statistically significant improvement in several itch-related secondary outcomes ( all ps&lt;0.05 ) . This study demonstrated initial effectiveness of an online intervention to improve itch-related QoL means quality of life among individuals with AD means atopic dermatitis or psoriasis and chronic itch . Future studies should address limitations by randomizing more heterogeneous participants , utilizing a longer follow up , and assessing medication use .\n",
        "Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 means Coronavirus disease 2019 ) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) . The ongoing COVID-19 means Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected both daily life and medical care ; therefore , the aim of this study was to analyze the use of biologics for inflammatory skin diseases during the COVID-19 means Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in our hospital . The observation period was between 1 January 2020 and 23 February 2021 . In this study , we enrolled 227 patients with psoriasis , six patients with palmoplantar pustulosis ( PPP means palmoplantar pustulosis ) , 69 patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , and five patients with hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS means hidradenitis suppurativa ) . Bioswitch was performed in 25 patients with psoriasis ( 11.0 % ) . Biologics were discontinued in 14 patients with psoriasis ( 6.2 % ) , 10 patients with AD means atopic dermatitis ( 14.5 % ) , and four patients with HS means hidradenitis suppurativa ( 80.0 % ) ; they were not discontinued in patients with PPP means palmoplantar pustulosis . The introduction of biologics was observed in 27 patients with psoriasis ( 11.9 % ) , four patients with PPP means palmoplantar pustulosis ( 66.7 % ) , 33 patients with AD means atopic dermatitis ( 47.8 % ) , and two patients with HS means hidradenitis suppurativa ( 40.0 % ) . The use of telephone consultations was observed in four patients with psoriasis and two patients with AD means atopic dermatitis . One patient , who received adalimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis , suffered from COVID-19 means Coronavirus disease 2019 and recovered after a mild course . In conclusion , we report our experience regarding the use of biologic drugs for inflammatory skin diseases . The use of biologics seemed safe for use amidst COVID-19 means Coronavirus disease 2019 infection during the observation period ; however , further observation on a larger number of patients is required to confirm the risks and benefits of biologic use in the COVID-19 means Coronavirus disease 2019 era .\n",
        "Overuse and misuse of antibiotics is a public health problem in low-income and middle-income countries . Although the association of antibiotics with atopic and allergic diseases has been established , most studies focused on prenatal exposure and the occurrence of disease in infants or young children . To investigate the association of preschool use of antibiotics with atopic and allergic skin diseases in young adulthood . Population-based retrospective cohort . The first-year college students ( n=20 123 ) from five universities were investigated . The sampled universities are located in Changsha , Wuhan , Xiamen , Urumqi and Hohhot , respectively . We conducted a dermatological field examination and a questionnaire survey inquiring the participants about the frequency of upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI means upper respiratory tract infection ) and the preschool antibiotics use ( prior to 7 years old ) . The two-level probit model was used to estimate the associations , and adjusted risk ratio ( aRR means adjusted risk ratio ) and 95 % CI were presented as the effect size . A total of 20 123 participants with complete information was included in the final analysis . The frequent antibiotics use intravenously ( aRR means adjusted risk ratio 1.36 , 95 % CI 1.14 to 1.62 ) and orally ( aRR means adjusted risk ratio 1.18 , 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.38 ) prior to 7 years old was significantly associated with atopic dermatitis in young adulthood . Similar trends could be observed in allergic skin diseases among those who use antibiotics orally and intravenously , with RRs of 1.16 ( 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.34 ) and 1.33 ( 95 % CI 1.13 to 1.57 ) , respectively .

        "Xerosis cutis is recognized as a burdensome and stressful condition of the skin , resulting in impaired health-related quality of life ( HRQoL means health-related quality of life ) . Therefore , it should be treated as a relevant skin disease with detailed care and treatment recommendations . This cross-sectional , exploratory study aimed to examine xerosis cutis-related burden from patient 's perspective and compare it with individuals without xerosis cutis . Within-group comparisons were also performed among patients with xerosis cutis associated with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) or not . The second aim was to assess the effect of a routinely applied basic skin care therapy in terms of burden release . Overall , 127 participants were included in the study . Patients with xerosis cutis reported a lower quality of life ( < i > p</i > = .041 ) , more dysmorphic concerns ( < i > p</i > & lt ; .001 ) , and higher general anxiety ( < i > p</i > = .029 ) than individuals without xerosis cutis . The presence of AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with lower HRQoL means health-related quality of life ( < i > p</i > = .023 ) , more depression ( < i > p</i > = .008 ) and anxiety symptoms ( < i > p</i > = .003 ) , and more stigmatization experiences at baseline ( < i > p</i > & lt ; .001 ) .

        "Some but not all patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) present with allergic conjunctival disease ( ACD means allergic conjunctival disease ) including severe types such as atopic keratoconjunctivitis ( AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis ) with/without giant papillae . We hypothesized that different factors are involved in the severity of ACD means allergic conjunctival disease and AD means atopic dermatitis . Recently we reported that hsa-miR-628 - 3p could affect the balance of innate immunity by suppressing pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as toll-like receptor 3 ( TLR3 means toll-like receptor 3 ) , RIG-I , and MDA-5 . We also reported that TLR3 means toll-like receptor 3 positively regulates ocular surface- and skin inflammation such as contact dermatitis and AD means atopic dermatitis . Here we compared the plasma level of miR-628 - 3p in AD means atopic dermatitis patients with severe AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis with giant papillae and/or shield ulcers , with the level in healthy controls and AD means atopic dermatitis patient without AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis or with very mild AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis . We used the plasma from 32 AD means atopic dermatitis patients with severe AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis , from 40 healthy controls , and from 23 AD means atopic dermatitis patient without AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis or with very mild AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis without giant papillae nor shield ulcers . Quantitative microRNA PCR assays were used to measure their plasma level of miR-628 - 3p . We found that plasma miR-628 - 3p was upregulated in AD means atopic dermatitis with severe AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis , but not in severe AD means atopic dermatitis without severe AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis , nor in our healthy controls . Our new findings suggest that the plasma miR-628 - 3p level may represent a marker to predict the presence of severe AKC means atopic keratoconjunctivitis in AD means atopic dermatitis patients .\n",
        "Lower socioeconomic position usually portends worse health outcomes , but multiple studies have found that atopic dermatitis is associated with higher socioeconomic position , but the nature of this relationship remains unclear . To systematically review the literature on socioeconomic position and atopic dermatitis and determine if the association varies by patient or study characteristics . A literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Embase databases . Individual-level studies addressing the association between all measures of socioeconomic position and the prevalence or incidence of atopic dermatitis were eligible for inclusion . Two independent reviewers screened all texts and extracted all data for qualitative synthesis . 88 studies met inclusion criteria . Overall , 42 % ( 37/88 ) of studies found atopic dermatitis to be positively associated with socioeconomic position , 15 % ( 13/88 ) found a negative association , and 43 % ( 38/88 ) found a null or inconsistent association . Studies conducted in Europe , among children , and based on self-report of eczema were more likely to find a positive association with socioeconomic position . Studies varied both in terms of measurement of socioeconomic position and definition of atopic dermatitis , limiting quantitative synthesis . There is not consistent evidence of a positive association between atopic dermatitis and socioeconomic position .\n",

        "Canine atopic dermatitis ( cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis ) is a common chronic relapsing pruritic skin disease for which management commonly relies on life-long use of immunomodulatory drugs . A number of the medications used are associated with adverse effects and the potential for complications during long-term use . The goal of the study was to determine if a complete and balanced diet formulated for therapeutic benefit could contribute towards management of cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis . We hypothesised that the diet would reduce pruritus while also reducing the requirement for medication during the study period . Forty privately owned dogs , having undergone a comprehensive diagnosis for cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis , were randomly allocated to two groups , each group being fed one of two diets ( test or control ) for up to nine months . We assessed pruritus , Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index-(4th iteration ) and medication score , the latter reflecting the medication required to maintain a satisfactory quality of life for the animal . Both diets were well-accepted and -tolerated . There was a significant improvement in the pruritus score after three months of feeding the therapeutic diet ( P = 0.0001 ) . No such improvement was observed at any time point in the group of dogs given the control diet . There was a reduced drug requirement for dogs receiving the therapeutic diet after three months ( P = 0.058 ) , and that decrease was significant at six months ( P = 0.021 ) and nine months ( P = 0.018 ) . No improvement was seen at any time point in the control group . The results suggest that a novel therapeutic diet can assist in the management of cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis by helping to control pruritus and reducing reliance on medication .

INTRODUCCIÓN : la dermatitis atópica canina ( cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis ) es una enfermedad cutánea pruriginosa recidivante crónica común para la que el tratamiento suele depender del uso de fármacos inmunomoduladores durante toda la vida . Varios de los medicamentos utilizados están asociados con efectos adversos y la posibilidad de complicaciones durante el uso a largo plazo . HIPÓTESIS : el objetivo del estudio fue determinar si una dieta completa y equilibrada formulada para obtener un beneficio terapéutico podría contribuir al manejo de la cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis . Presumimos que la dieta reduciría el prurito y al mismo tiempo reduciría la necesidad de medicación durante el período de estudio . ANIMALES , MATERIALES Y MÉTODOS : Cuarenta perros de propietarios particulares tras haberse sometido a un estudio diagnóstico completo de cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis , fueron asignados aleatoriamente a dos grupos , cada grupo alimentado con una de las dos dietas ( prueba o control ) durante un máximo de nueve meses . Se evaluó el prurito , el índice de extensión y gravedad de la dermatitis atópica canina ( cuarta revisión ) y la puntuación de la medicación , esta última reflejando la medicación necesaria para mantener una calidad de vida satisfactoria para el animal . RESULTADOS : Ambas dietas fueron bien aceptadas y toleradas . Hubo una mejora significativa en la valoración de prurito después de tres meses de alimentar la dieta terapéutica ( P = 0,0001 ) . No se observó tal mejora en ningún momento en el grupo de perros que recibió la dieta de control . Hubo un requerimiento reducido de medicamentos para los perros que recibieron la dieta terapéutica después de tres meses ( P = 0,058 ) , y esa disminución fue significativa a los seis meses ( P = 0,021 ) y nueve meses ( P = 0,018 ) . No se observó ninguna mejora en ningún momento en el grupo de control . CONCLUSIÓN : los resultados sugieren que una dieta terapéutica novedosa puede ayudar en el manejo de la cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis al ayudar a controlar el prurito y reducir la dependencia de la medicación . Die atopische Dermatitis des Hundes ( cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis ) ist eine häufige wiederkehrende juckende Erkrankung , bei der ein Management häufig auf lebenslanger Verabreichung von immunmodulatorischen Medikamenten beruht .

Das Ziel dieser Studie war es festzustellen , ob eine komplette und ausgewogene Ernährung , die zu therapeutischen Zwecken formuliert wurde , beim Management der cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis beitragen kann . Wir stellten die Hypothese auf , dass die Diät den Juckreiz reduzieren würde , während sie ebenso die Notwendigkeit einer Medikation während der Studienperiode reduzieren könnte . Vierzig Hunde i m Privatbesitz , bei denen eine umfassende Diagnose von cAD means Canine atopic dermatitis gestellt wurde , wurden zufällig in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt ; jeder Gruppe wurden bis zu neun Monate lang eine von zwei Diäten ( Test oder Kontrolle ) gefüttert . Wir erfassten den Pruritus , den Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index-(4<sup > te</sup > Auflage ) und die medizinische Bewertung , wobei letztere die Medikation reflektiert , die nötig ist , um eine zufriedenstellende Lebensqualität des Tieres zu erhalten . Beide Diäten wurden gerne gefressen und gut toleriert . Nach drei Monaten der therapeutischen Nahrung bestand eine signifikante Verbesserung bei den Prurituswerten ( P = 0,0001 ) . Eine derartige Verbesserung wurde zu keinem Zeitpunkt bei der Hundegruppe beobachtet , welche die Kontrolldiät erhielt . Nach drei Monaten bestand eine geringere Notwendigkeit ( P = 0,058 ) bei jenen Hunden , die die therapeutische Diät erhielten , Medikamente einzusetzen . Diese Reduktion war nach sechs ( P = 0,021 ) und neun Monaten ( P = 0,018 ) signifikant . Zu keinem der Zeitpunkte wurde eine derartige Verbesserung in der Kontrollgruppe gesehen .

        "Enhancing the skin barrier in high-risk neonates by daily use of emollients during infancy might prevent atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) ; however , there have been no studies on this topic in a country with a tropical climate . Climate may affect the results of the use of emollients in neonates for AD means atopic dermatitis prevention and possible adverse cutaneous eruptions . To test the hypothesis that emollients used during infancy can prevent AD means atopic dermatitis in high-risk neonates in a country with a tropical climate and to evaluate other possible adverse cutaneous eruptions in this population . This was a randomized controlled study in a tertiary care hospital with a 6 months ' duration . Eligible neonates were randomly assigned to receive either emollient and skincare advice ( emollient group ) or skincare advice only ( control group ) . The intervention was started within 3 weeks of birth . The emollient group showed a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of AD means atopic dermatitis at 6 months ( relative risk , 0.39 ; 95 % CI 0.24 - 0.64 ; P & lt ; 0.001 ) . The emollient group started to develop AD means atopic dermatitis later and had a lower severity of AD means atopic dermatitis than the control group ( P & lt ; 0.001 ) . Compared to moderate adherence , low adherence to emollient application was associated with a lower number of patients with AD means atopic dermatitis ( P = 0.008 ) . Potentially emollient-related cutaneous eruptions , such as miliaria , and suspected cutaneous infections , such as impetigo , were more frequent in the emollient group . Exposure to passive smoking showed a significant difference in the development of AD means atopic dermatitis compared to non-smoking exposure , both during pregnancy and after the child 's birth ( P & lt ; 0.001 ) . This study suggests that , in a tropical climate , emollient applied to the skin of at-risk neonates on an ' as needed ' basis ( depending on environmental factors , level of skin dryness ) , rather than on a ' daily basis ' , can provide a substantial benefit for AD means atopic dermatitis prevention .\n",
        "With AtopicHealth1 , the first national care study on atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) was conducted in 2010 . At that time , about one third of the patients undergoing treatment by dermatologists showed severe limitations in quality of life , which indicated an insufficient quality of care . The aim of the present study was to characterise the current care of patients with AD means atopic dermatitis undergoing dermatological treatment in comparison between different severity grades , as well as in comparison to 2010 and to psoriasis . The Germany-wide multicentre cross-sectional study \" AtopicHealth2 \" recorded clinical data , quality of life ( DLQI means Daten, Lebensqualität ) , therapies , preventive behaviour and patient-defined treatment benefit ( PBI means patient-defined treatment benefit ) . Patients with an indication for systemic therapy were considered moderately to severely affected for subgroup analyses , the others mildly affected . Between 2017 and 2019 , 1291 patients ( median age 41 years , 56.5 % female ) were enrolled by 111 centres . Compared with 2010 , there were no improvements in quality of life ( DLQI means Daten, Lebensqualität 8.5 in both studies ) , severity ( SCORAD 45.4 vs. 42.3 in 2010 ) or treatment benefit ( PBI means patient-defined treatment benefit 2.2 vs. 2.4 in 2010 ) . Moderately to severely affected patients were more likely to show impaired quality of life ( 45.4 % vs. 23.6 % ) and less likely to have relevant treatment benefits ( PBI means patient-defined treatment benefit & lt ; 1 : 21.3 % vs. 13.2 % ) than mildly affected patients . In contrast to psoriasis , patients with AD means atopic dermatitis revealed higher quality of life limitations ( DLQI means Daten, Lebensqualität 8.5 vs. 6.1 ) and lower treatment benefit ( PBI means patient-defined treatment benefit 2.2 vs. 2.8 ) . Compared to 2010 , there is no improvement in the quality of care for AD means atopic dermatitis in Germany . Compared to psoriasis , patients with AD means atopic dermatitis show higher burden and lower treatment benefit , which underlines the need for therapeutic innovations .

        "Contact allergy is increasingly recognized as being important in children means children were patch tested between January 2010 and December 2019 with the European with eczema . To retrospectively analyze the patch-test results in them over the past 10 years , aiming to ( i ) evaluate demographic characteristics and lesion locations , ( ii ) describe frequencies of positive patch-test reactions , and ( iii ) investigate the relationship with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . 329 children means children were patch tested between January 2010 and December 2019 with the European were patch tested between January 2010 and December 2019 with the European ( children means children were patch tested between January 2010 and December 2019 with the European ) baseline series and/or other series , and the personal product(s ) used . 119 ( 36 % ) children means children were patch tested between January 2010 and December 2019 with the European presented with at least one positive reaction . Children with AD means atopic dermatitis had a higher prevalence of positive reactions compared to the non-AD group ( P = .002 ) , but without statistically significant difference regarding sensitization to more than one hapten ( P = .39 ) . The face ( 20.2 % ) , hands ( 19.3 % ) , feet ( 16.8 % ) , arms ( 12.6 % ) , and body folds ( 10.9 % ) were the most common primary localizations . The most frequent contact allergens were nickel sulfate and linalool hydroperoxide ( both 16 % ) , limonene hydroperoxide ( 13.5 % ) , and para-phenylenediamine ( 10.9 % ) . No statistically significant difference for nickel sulfate was found between the AD means atopic dermatitis and non-AD group ( P = .20 ) . Contact allergy in children means children were patch tested between January 2010 and December 2019 with the European with eczema was frequently observed in our tertiary referral center in Belgium as well , confirming the need for patch testing .

        "The risk of osteoporosis has been explored in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . The long-term risk of fractures in AD means atopic dermatitis patients and the effects of various AD means atopic dermatitis treatment on bone health remain to be elucidated . To examine the long-term risk of fractures in AD means atopic dermatitis patients . This nationwide matched cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan 's National Health Insurance Research Database , for the period 1997 to 2013 . A total of 36,855 AD means atopic dermatitis patients and 147,420 reference subjects without AD means atopic dermatitis were identified . Demographic characteristics and comorbidities were compared , and cumulative incidence of fractures was examined . Adjusted hazard ratios for fracture risks of AD means atopic dermatitis and various AD means atopic dermatitis treatment were calculated using Cox proportional hazard model . A total of 1,518 patients ( 4.12 % ) in the AD means atopic dermatitis cohort and 5,579 patients ( 3.78 % ) in the reference cohort had fractures ( p=.003 ) . The mean ages were 22.6 years in both groups . The 16-year cumulative incidence of fractures in the AD means atopic dermatitis cohort ( 8.043 % ) was significantly higher than that in the reference cohort ( 7.366 % ) ( p=.002 ) . Severe AD means atopic dermatitis ( adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] 1.31 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.08 - 1.59 ) was independently associated with fractures . Other independent risk factors included exposure to topical ( aHR 1.21 , 95 % CI 1.05 - 1.39 ) or systemic corticosteroids ( ≥10 mg/day , aHR 1.62 , 95 % CI 1.38 - 1.91 ) . Use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs ( aHR 0.71 , 95 % CI 0.53 - 0.90 ) and phototherapy ( aHR 0.73 , 95 % CI 0.56 - 0.95 ) were associated with a lower risk of fractures . The results were consistent across sensitivity analyses . AD means atopic dermatitis patients have a higher incidence of fractures . Severe AD means atopic dermatitis is independently associated with fractures .\n",
        "Total serum IgE ( tIgE means Total serum IgE ) is an important intermediate phenotype of allergic disease . Whole genome genetic association studies across ancestries may identify important determinants of IgE. By leveraging data from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed means Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ) program , the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas ( CAAPA means Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas ) and the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network ( ADRN means Atopic Dermatitis Research Network ) , we aim to increase understanding of genetic variants affecting tIgE means Total serum IgE production across the ancestry and allergic disease spectrum ( N=21,901 ) . We performed genome-wide association within strata of study , disease , and ancestry groups , and combined results via a meta-regression approach that models heterogeneity attributable to ancestry . We also tested for association between HLA alleles called from whole genome sequence data and tIgE means Total serum IgE , assessing replication of associations in HLA alleles called from genotype array data . For details , please see the Methods section in this article 's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org . We identified six loci at genome-wide significance ( P&lt;5x10 - 9 ) , including four loci previously reported as genome-wide significant for tIgE means Total serum IgE , as well as new regions in chr11q13.5 and chr15q22.2 , also identified in prior GWAS of atopic dermatitis and asthma . In the HLA allele association study , HLA-A*02:01 was associated with decreased tIgE means Total serum IgE ( discovery P = 2x10<sup>-4</sup > , replication P = 5x10<sup>-4</sup > , discovery+replication P=4x10<sup>-7</sup > ) and HLA-DQB1 * 03:02 was strongly associated with decreased tIgE means Total serum IgE in Hispanic/Latino ancestry populations ( Hispanic/Latino discovery+replication P=8x10 - 8) . We performed the largest GWAS and HLA association study of tIgE means Total serum IgE focused on ancestrally diverse populations and found several known tIgE means Total serum IgE and allergic disease loci that are relevant in non-European ancestry populations .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis , known also as atopic eczema , represents a commonly diagnosed , chronic or recurrent/relapsing inflammatory disorder . From a clinical point of view , it is characterized by acute flare-ups of intense itching , eczematous pruritic lesions involving dry skin . Dupilumab is the only biologic agent approved to treat moderate to severe course of atopic dermatitis , which can be particularly severe during pregnancy causing distress and impacting on maternal and fetal health . However , there is a dearth of data concerning the safety profile of Dupilumab during gestation . Therefore , we took advantage of a large global pharmacovigilance database . From inception up to March 9 , 2021 , 94,065 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs means adverse drug reactions ) from 37,848 unique reports were retrieved . Of these , 36 reports related to pregnancy , puerperium and perinatal ADR could be extracted from the pharmacovigilance database . More than half of reports ( n = 21 ; 58.3 % ) were spontaneous abortion , followed by other events , including exposure to the drug during the pregnancy ( n = 8 ; 22.2 % ) . Two cases of abortion were reported . No studied pregnancy , puerperium and perinatal ADR was found to be associated with the use of Dupilumab . The only OR significantly greater than 1 was the OR associated with the risk of developing heterotopic pregnancy ( 21.66 [ 95 % CrI 2.95 - 159.02 ] ) even if the IC was highly imprecise ( 1.45 [ 95 % CrI from -2.34 to 3.09 ] ) , probably because of the single case of heterotopic pregnancy reported . In conclusion , Dupilumab use appears safe during gestation . Further studies are needed , especially to better understand the mechanisms underlying the pharmacological actions and ADR of Dupilumab .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is characterized by immune dysregulation , which may predispose toward worse COVID-19 outcomes . We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the relationship of atopic dermatitis with COVID-19 symptom severity , hospitalization , length of hospital stay , requirement for oxygen therapy , long-term morbidity and mortality . Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to examine the impact of atopic dermatitis ( independent variable ) on COVID-19 symptom severity , hospitalization , length of hospital stay , requirement for oxygen therapy , long-term morbidity and mortality ( dependent variables ) . SARS-CoV-2 positive adult patients with diagnosed AD had similar odds of hospitalization ( adjusted odds ratio [ 95 % confidence interval ] : 0.51 [ 0.20 - 1.35 ] ) , acute level of care at initial medical care ( 0.67 [ 0.35 - 1.30 ] ) , severe-critical SARS-CoV-2 ( 0.82 [ 0.29 - 2.30 ] ) , requirement of supplemental non-mechanical oxygen therapy ( 1.33 [ 0.50 - 3.58 ] ) , extended hospital stay ( 2.24 [ 0.36 - 13.85 ] ) , lingering COVID-19 symptoms ( 0.58 [ 0.06 - 5.31 ] ) and COVID-19 death ( 0.002 [ & lt ; 0.001- & gt ; 999 ] ) compared to patients without AD . Our findings suggest AD is not an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity or complications .\n",
        "The efficacy assessment of human anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs means monoclonal antibodies ) in animal models before clinical trials is hampered due to the lack of cross-reactivity of anti-IgE mAbs means monoclonal antibodies between species . We developed CRE-DR ( an anti-dog IgE monoclonal antibody ) , an anti-IgE mouse mAb that recognizes canine and human IgE , and then examined its IgE specificity and cross-reactivity between three animal and human species . After mouse immunization with a synthetic peptide derived from canine IgE ( < sup>282</sup > NTNDWIEGETYYC < sup>294</sup > ) , we generated a hybridoma producing CRE-DR . The CRE-DR purified from the ascites of hybridoma-inoculated mice was used for ELISA and Western blot analysis to examine reactivity to dog , human , and rodent IgEs as well as recombinant bovine serum albumin (BSA)-conjugated to canine , human , and rodent IgE amino acid peptides corresponding to the immunizing sequence . We then performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs means enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ) for dog IgE using sera from dogs with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) after inhibition with canine IgE and IgG. The amino acid sequence recognized by CRE-DR was identified by ELISA using synthetic peptides . CRE-DR is a monoclonal mouse IgG1κ specific for dog IgE , and the ELISA values in atopic dog sera were inhibited by dog IgE , but not dog IgG. The binding of CRE-DR to human IgE was relatively maintained , but not to rodent IgEs , which results were confirmed with the BSA-conjugated IgE peptides of the various species . The CRE-DR reactivity was supported by the comparison of amino acid sequence of CRE-DR epitope , DWIEGETYYC , in dog IgE ; one , two , and three amino acids were substituted in the human , rat , and mouse IgE epitopes , respectively . CRE-DR is a mAb cross-reactive to dog and human IgEs , which can allow the use of a dog model of allergy to test the efficacy of a CRE-DR-derived anti-IgE therapeutic mAb before human clinical trials .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory dermatoses characterized by persistent itching and recurrent eczematous lesions . While the primary events and key drivers of AD means Atopic dermatitis are topics of ongoing debate , cutaneous inflammation due to inappropriate IgE (auto)antibody-related immune reactions is frequently considered . Highly conserved and immunogenic heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 means heat shock protein 90 ) , a key intra- and extracellular chaperone , can activate the immune response driving the generation of circulating anti-Hsp90 autoantibodies that are found to be elevated in several autoimmune disorders . Here , for the first time , we observed that serum levels of Hsp90 means heat shock protein 90 and anti-Hsp90 IgE autoantibodies are significantly elevated ( p & lt ; 0.0001 ) in AD means Atopic dermatitis patients ( n = 29 ) when compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls ( n = 70 ) . We revealed a positive correlation ( 0.378 , p = 0.042 ) between serum levels of Hsp90 means heat shock protein 90 and the severity of AD means Atopic dermatitis assessed by Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD means Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ) . In addition , seropositivity for anti-Hsp90 IgE has been found in 48.27 % of AD means Atopic dermatitis patients and in 2.85 % of healthy controls . Although further studies on a larger group of patients are needed to confirm presented data , our results suggest that extracellular Hsp90 means heat shock protein 90 and autoantibodies to Hsp90 means heat shock protein 90 deserve attention in the study of the mechanisms that promote the development and/or maintenance of atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "The JAK-STAT pathway is involved in the signaling of multiple cytokines driving cutaneous inflammation in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Janus kinase ( JAK means Janus kinase ) inhibitors target individual receptor-associated kinases , thereby preventing the mediation of inflammatory signals . Several JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors with varying mechanism of action , potency , and safety represent potential therapeutic options for AD means atopic dermatitis in both topical and systemic application . The JAK1/2 selective JAK means Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib was the first substance from this class of drugs approved by the EMA for the systemic oral treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis . The clinical development program of the JAK1 selective inhibitors upadacitinib and abrocitinib is finalized with positive results for AD means atopic dermatitis . The PAN-JAK inhibitor delgocitinib was the first substance being approved for the treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis ( in Japan ) . This review article covers the rising data on investigational and approved JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors in the context of the treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "The increased permeability of the skin barrier towards environmental factors such as allergens is considered a key factor in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Strengthening the skin barrier through basic skin therapy represents the basis of any therapy for AD means atopic dermatitis . It is well known that genetic factors as well as the skin inflammation itself contribute to the weakening of the barrier ; here , recent studies have led to a deeper understanding of the complex structures of the epidermis . The possibility of counteracting the disease preventively by the use of basic skin therapy from birth on has been studied intensively in recent years . This article summarizes recent findings on the effects of basic skin therapy as a primary and secondary preventive measure .\n",
        "The TREATgermany registry collects data from children , adolescents , and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in Germany . For this purpose , clinical and patient-reported outcomes , the course of the disease , and applied therapies are observed . TREATgermany recruits patients with moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis according to the diagnostic criteria of the UK Working Party , an \" Objective Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis \" ( oSCORAD means Objective Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis\" ) & gt ; 20 and/or currently antiinflammatory systemic treatment for AD means atopic dermatitis or previous anti-inflammatory systemic treatment for AD means atopic dermatitis within past 24 months before inclusion . No study related interventions will be performed . Currently , 59 dermatological practices , clinics , and university hospitals are participating in TREATgermany ( as of May 2021 ) . Based on the interim analysis of October 13 , 2020 , patient characteristics were described from 4,373 documented visits of adult participants ( n = 1,025 ) . The mean age at inclusion in TREATgermany was 42 years , 57.7 % of patients were men ( n = 591 ) and 42.3 % were women ( n = 434 ) . According to oSCORAD means Objective Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis\" , 85.8 % of those included suffered from moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis . At baseline visit , 744 patients had already received one or more systemic treatments for AD means atopic dermatitis ( glucocorticosteroids n = 600 , ciclosporin A ( CSA means ciclosporin A ) n = 307 , dupilumab n = 98 ) . 597 patients received dupilumab during their participation in TREATgermany , 134 patients received CSA means ciclosporin A . With the increasing number of recruitment centers ( October 2020 : 38 centers ; May 2021 : 59 centers ) , TREATgermany can continue to make an important contribution to health services research for patients with moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis . The registry fulfills the methodological requirements of IQWiG for the collection and processing of healthcare-related data . With the successful and expected approval of further systemic treatments , these can be compared in terms of efficacy and safety in the future . In addition , with the recruitment of children and adolescents started in 2021 , this patient group can also be observed .\n",
        "The era of biologics for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) began in 2017 with the approval of dupilumab , a monoclonal antibody that binds to the α-subunit of the interleukin IL-4 receptor . Until then , only conventional immunosuppressants were available for systemic treatment , of which only cyclosporine is approved for the treatment of severe AD means atopic dermatitis . In the meantime , the therapeutic landscape of AD means atopic dermatitis has been changing rapidly , and additional biologics have been developed which target IL-13 , the IL-31 receptor , OX40 , and OX40L , among others . Many of these substances have already shown promising results in phase 1 , 2 , and in some cases also phase 3 trials . In June 2021 , tralokinumab , an IL-13 antibody , has been approved in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis in adults . In addition to antibody-based therapies , \" small molecules \" that , e.g. , inhibit Janus kinases enrich the armamentarium of systemic AD means atopic dermatitis therapies . With all these agents , not only will many more targeted therapies become available , but also will the complex and heterogeneous pathophysiological processes of this disease be better understood .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that arises from polygenic disposition , a dysfunction of the physicochemical epithelial barrier , a cutaneous dysbiosis , and a faulty neurosensory activity and shows a highly individual acuity due to epigenetic factors . An essential component of therapeutic management is the application of anti-inflammatory topical medication . Currently , topical glucocorticoids and topical calcineurin inhibitors are routinely used in reactive and proactive therapy . In recent years , the development of molecular medicine has identified several new therapeutic targets that have enabled the development of innovative therapeutic approaches . In addition to phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors and aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulators , it is mainly Janus kinase inhibitors with different selectivity that are emerging as new effective and safe options for topical therapy . The current data suggests that in the coming months and years representatives of the above-mentioned substance classes will be approved for topical use .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) , also known as atopic eczema , is one of the most common skin diseases and is characterized by allergic skin inflammation , redness , and itchiness and is associated with a hyperactivated type 2 immune response . The leading causes of AD means Atopic dermatitis include an imbalance in the immune system , genetic predisposition , or environmental factors , making the development of effective pharmacotherapies complex . Steroids are widely used to treat AD means Atopic dermatitis ; however , they provide limited efficacy in the long term and can lead to adverse effects . Thus , novel treatments that offer durable efficacy and fewer side effects are urgently needed . Here , we investigated the therapeutic potential of Huangbai Liniment ( HB means Huangbai Liniment ) , a traditional Chinese medicine , using an experimental AD means Atopic dermatitis mouse model , following our clinical observations of AD means Atopic dermatitis patients . In both AD means Atopic dermatitis patient and the mouse disease model , HB means Huangbai Liniment significantly improved the disease condition . Specifically , patients who received HB means Huangbai Liniment treatment on local skin lesions ( 3 - 4 times/day ) showed improved resolution of inflammation . Using the 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD means Atopic dermatitis model in BALB/c mice , we observed that HB means Huangbai Liniment profoundly alleviated severe skin inflammation and relieved the itching . The dermatopathological results showed markedly reversed skin inflammation with decreased epidermal thickness and overall cellularity . Correspondingly , HB means Huangbai Liniment treatment largely decreased the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines , including IL-1β , TNF-α , IL-17 , IL-4 , and IL-13 , associated with declined gene expression of IL-33 , ST2 , and GATA3 , which are connected to the type 2 immune response . In addition , HB means Huangbai Liniment restored immune tolerance by promoting regulatory T ( T < sub > REG</sub > ) cells and inhibiting the generation of T < sub > H</sub>1 , T < sub > H</sub>2 , and T < sub > H</sub>17 cells < i > in vitro</i > and in the DNCB-induced AD means Atopic dermatitis mouse model . For the first time , we demonstrate that HB means Huangbai Liniment markedly mitigates skin inflammation in AD means Atopic dermatitis patients and the DNCB-induced AD means Atopic dermatitis mouse model by reinvigorating the T cell immune balance , shedding light on the future development and application of novel HB-based therapeutics for AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "In the first part of this review , we have summarized the methods used to examine skin exposure to air pollution and the fundamental concept of skin-exposome interactions . Part 2 of this review focuses on dermatoses , whose aggravation or initiation by air pollution has been confirmed in evidence based medicine manner . Based on the model of photodermatology and photodermatoses , we propose a new concept of \" polludermatoses . \" A key feature of this concept is identifying patients at risk , which will reveal the noxious effects of air pollutants on skin health . Identifying clinical signs of pollution-damaged skin could be beneficial in categorizing conditions caused or exacerbated by exposure to air pollution . Finally , we discuss the current treatment options and the pathogenetic processes targeted by these therapeutics or the development of novel treatment modalities .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a relapsing and remitting chronic inflammatory skin disease for which a variety of etiological factors are involved . Treatment strategies should be multifaceted and have few side effects . In this respect , acupuncture has become increasingly popular as a safe , consistently effective , and drug-free therapy that treats multiple AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms . We aim to not only verify the effectiveness of acupuncture but also suggest patient-specific response determinants and a new underlying mechanism implicating the gut-brain axis . We have designed a randomized , participant-blinded , sham-controlled clinical trial for 60 mild to moderate AD means Atopic dermatitis patients . In a previous study , we observed that the clinical skin symptoms of AD means Atopic dermatitis were closely associated with gastrointestinal ( GI means gastrointestinal ) symptoms . From these findings , we developed an intervention with six acupuncture points : three for AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms and three for GI means gastrointestinal symptoms . Also , since high responders and low responders to the acupuncture treatment could be identified in the previous study , we now aim to explore response-determining factors , with a particular focus on GI means gastrointestinal symptoms . Therefore , we will precisely evaluate not only AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms using the SCORAD , EASI , and DLQI tools , but also GI means gastrointestinal symptoms using the GSRS , TDS , BSFS , and AR tools and abdominal examination . AD means Atopic dermatitis develops in association with complicated pathophysiological factors , such as skin barrier function , genetic susceptibility , and immunological factors . Moreover , the underlying mechanism by which acupuncture treatment works has not been clearly elucidated . We , therefore , will conduct a simultaneous cross-sectional study with a sample of 40 healthy individuals , wherein potential indicators , such as fMRI , gut microbiota , and serum TARC and ATX , will be investigated to determine the gut-brain axis-associated mechanism of acupuncture . We expect that the results of this study could provide important clinical evidence for the effects of acupuncture and help elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms that underlie acupuncture 's efficacy in AD means Atopic dermatitis treatment .

        "Studies investigated the associations between four Vitamin D receptor ( VDR means Vitamin D receptor ) common variations and interactions of gene-environment factors and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in Chinese population are few . In this case-control study , 400 AD means atopic dermatitis patients and 400 controls were genotyped for the FokI , TaqI , BsmI and ApalI variations of VDR means Vitamin D receptor genes by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis . The associations between VDR means Vitamin D receptor genes and AD means atopic dermatitis were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression . The interactions between VDR means Vitamin D receptor genes and some risk factors were also explored using cross-over analysis . The corresponding odds ratio ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI means confidence intervals ) were also calculated . The FoKI rs2228570 polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis in the co-dominant model ( OR=2.93 , 95 % CI means confidence intervals : 1.78 - 4.82 . < i > P</i>=0.000 ) , recessive model ( OR=2.67 , 95 % CI means confidence intervals : 1.68 - 4.26 , < i > P</i>=0.000 ) and dominant model ( OR=1.38 , 95 % CI means confidence intervals : 1.04 - 1.84 , < i > P</i>=0.028 ) , and allele model . No significant associations were found among TaqI , BsmI and ApalI polymorphism and AD means atopic dermatitis . The C-A-T-C and C-G-T-T haplotypes significantly increased the risk of atopic dermatitis . For rs2228570 , the increased effects were more evident in the subgroups of age ≤8-month , cow milk and mixed , and keeping pet . Interactions between rs2228570 gene polymorphism and family history , age & gt;8 , and keeping pet increased the AD means atopic dermatitis risk . The rs2228570 C allele decreased the relative mRNA expression . The FokI rs2228570 C allele of VDR means Vitamin D receptor gene could be a risk candidate gene for AD means atopic dermatitis . Interactions between FokI polymorphism and family history and some behaviors may increase the risk of AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Dupilumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks signalling pathways of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 , is effective in treating patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . We previously showed that transitions of serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine ( TARC means thymus and activation-regulated chemokine ) levels and eosinophil numbers were strongly associated with that of AD means atopic dermatitis activity and that the transitions of serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH means lactate dehydrogenase ) and immunoglobulin E ( IgE means immunoglobulin E ) levels were weakly and not associated with that of AD means atopic dermatitis activity , respectively , in patients treated without dupilumab . The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the association of the transition of laboratory marker levels and transition of disease activity in dupilumab-treated AD means atopic dermatitis patients ( present study ) was different from that in patients who are not treated with dupilumab ( previous study ) . Sixty AD means atopic dermatitis outpatients treated with dupilumab were included in this study . Associations between the transition of the eczema area and severity index ( EASI means eczema area and severity index ) score and those of above-mentioned laboratory marker levels were evaluated using a mixed effects model of EASI means eczema area and severity index as the response variable , laboratory markers as fixed effects and patients as random effects . The transitions of serum TARC means thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and LDH means lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated strongly with that of AD means atopic dermatitis activity , but the transitions of serum IgE means immunoglobulin E level and eosinophil numbers were associated with that of AD means atopic dermatitis activity intermediately and weakly , respectively . Laboratory markers are useful for evaluating the effects of treatments for AD means atopic dermatitis , but the meaning of each laboratory marker depends on the drugs used for treatment .\n",
        "Recent studies have described an association between altered skin microbial community and epidemiology of skin diseases , such as vitiligo , atopic dermatitis and psoriasis . In this study , we conducted microbiological analysis on patients at different stages of vitiligo to determine whether the dysbiosis is associated with disease progression . To characterise the skin microbes in vitiligo patients , we profiled samples collected from 40 patients with active and stable vitiligo using the Novaseq sequencer . Alpha diversity was used to measure richness and uniformity , while Beta diversity ( Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling ) analysis was used to show the differences . Moreover , the species differences were evaluated by LEfSe analysis and the flora gene function was predicted using Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles ( STAMP means Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles ) . The alpha diversity results showed no significant differences between active vitiligo and stable vitiligo , while beta diversity and LEfSe analysis results showed the differences in community composition . Streptomyces and Streptococcus were enriched in active vitiligo compared to stable vitiligo . In addition , the flora gene function of mixed acid fermentation was more pronounced in active vitiligo , while the function of lipid IVA biosynthesis was more significant in stable vitiligo . This study has shown the differences in epidermal microbes between active vitiligo and stable vitiligo . Our results suggest that maintaining the flora balance might be a potential therapeutic target for vitiligo .\n",
        "Clinically complex phenotypes require more and more sophisticated and comprehensive diagnostic approaches , able to discriminate genuine sensitizations from cross-reactivity . Interpretative complexity of multiplex diagnostic arrays has somewhat limited their diffusion . This study compares two currently available methods , namely ISAC < sup> ® </sup > test and ALEX2<sup> ® </sup > test . In total , 140 allergic individuals , with a history of atopic dermatitis , adverse food reactions , allergic rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma were studied by Allergy Explorer-ALEX2<sup> ® </sup > macroarray and ImmunoCAP ISAC112<sup> ® </sup > . Lin 's concordance correlation coefficient , intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots were used to verify the agreement between continuous values . Cohen 's kappa coefficient ( k ) was assessed for the molecules available in both tests . The degree of relationship was analysed using Spearman 's correlation ( quantitative variables ) and Pearson 's χ < sup>2</sup > or Fisher 's exact test ( categorical variables ) . A substantial agreement ( κ = 0.795 ) was observed between the two methods with 94,3 % concordant results when results were dichotomized as negative or positive , but if double-negative results were discarded , the agreement dropped to 71 % . Conversely , little or no concordance was observed comparing raw data . Considering the 102 molecules shared by both systems , 28/102 ( 27 % ) showed an almost perfect agreement ( k & gt ; 0.81 ) , and concordance was good ( k & gt ; 0.61 ) in a further 32 ( 31 % ) cases . A perfect to substantial agreement was observed by comparing species-specific aeroallergens . Heterogeneous results emerged comparing panallergens ( co-recognition ranging from 30 % for tropomyosin/serum albumins to 70 % for PR-10/profilin ) . The correlation among LTP , profilin and PR-10 assayed with ISAC < sup> ® </sup > was better than ALEX2<sup> ® </sup > , but the latter identified more positive cases due to the wider number of molecules available . The CCD blocker provided by ALEX < sup> ® </sup > test abolishes the carbohydrate determinants signal in 60 % of the 33 cases reactive to MUXF3 on the ISAC < sup> ® </sup > test . Despite the excellent concordance of the species-specific markers , the analysis of the panallergens provided in both methods suggests a better performance of the ISAC < sup> ® </sup > test on those components , while the ALEX2<sup> ® </sup > test , which includes a larger number of allergens , allowing a broader molecular detection .\n",
        "The pathological process of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) progressing into other types of allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis during the first several years of life is often referred to as the atopic march . Although the phenomenon of atopic march has been recognized for decades , how asthma stems from AD means atopic dermatitis is still not fully understood , confounding a universal strategy to effectively protect people from the atopic march . We established experimental atopic march mice by first inducing allergic dermatitis with 0.5 % fluorescein isothiocyante ( FITC means fluorescein isothiocyante ) applied to the skin , followed by an ovalbumin ( OVA means ovalbumin ) airway challenge . In addition , by examining serum immunoglobulin ( Ig means immunoglobulin ) concentrations , airway cytokines , the levels of oxidative stress markers , histopathological changes in lung tissue and airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR means airway hyperresponsiveness ) , we were able to validate the successful establishment of the model . Furthermore , by detecting the attenuating effects of melatonin ( MT means melatonin ) and the levels of oxidative stress in the atopic march mice , we explored the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the development of atopic march . By successfully establishing an experimental atopic march mouse model , we were able to demonstrate that overproduction of oxidative stress in the lung significantly up-regulated the activation of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB means nuclear factor-κB ) signaling pathways causing thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP means thymic stromal lymphopoietin ) release , which further promotes the development of atopic march . To mitigate the development of the atopic march , antioxidants such as MT means melatonin may be imperative to inhibit NF-κB means nuclear factor-κB activation in the lung , especially after the onset of AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Patients with severe group A Streptococcus ( GAS means group A Streptococcus ) induced necrotizing soft tissue infection sometimes develop Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome , which is a life-threatening condition with an extremely high fatality rate . Obtaining survival is the most important goal ; however , an early diagnosis for debridement surgery and quick granulation formation for skin grafting surgery can better preserve the extremity functions . The patient was a 47-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who presented with GAS-induced necrotizing soft tissue infection in his left lower extremity . His vital signs indicated shock , and he was diagnosed with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome . Emergency surgery was performed with his body pressure maintained with noradrenaline . Intraoperatively , rapid antigen detection tests ( RADTs means rapid antigen detection tests ) were negative in the medial thigh and positive in the lower leg , which helped in decision-making regarding the area of aggressive debridement surgery . The wound culture results matched the intraoperative rapid antigen detection test results . A collagen/gelatin sponge with the sustained release of basic fibroblast growth factor was used as an artificial dermis before skin grafting . Excellent granulation was obtained , and skin grafting surgery was performed on the 11th day after collagen/gelatin sponge placement . He was discharged home on the 42nd day with normal lower extremity functions . First , an intraoperative diagnosis using GAS-rapid antigen detection tests with an appropriate sampling method from small incisions avoided excessive surgical debridement . Second , collagen/gelatin sponge with the sustained release of basic fibroblast growth factor promoted quick granulation tissue formation for wound bed preparation . These efforts resulted in the successful less-invasive treatment of a patient with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by GAS-induced necrotizing soft tissue infection .\n",
        "Primary herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV-1 means herpes simplex virus 1 ) infection in children ( beyond the neonatal period ) may be asymptomatic or manifest as herpetic gingivostomatitis accompanied by fever and other symptoms . However , severe , health- and life-threatening infection is observed in rare cases , especially in at-risk patients . Children with atopic dermatitis may develop extensive eczema herpeticum ( < i > eruptio varicelliformis Kaposi</i > ) . Herpes simplex eye infection , herpes simplex encephalitis , and disseminated ( generalized ) herpes infection also pose danger . We present a boy with exacerbated infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis ( ISD means infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis ) and eczema herpeticum complicated by streptococcal sepsis . HSV transmission should be limited if possible by avoiding direct contact with those who recently developed lesions . Communication with parents and explaining how to properly care for the skin in a child with skin diseases that disturb its barrier function protecting against external factors is particularly important . Also , parents should be informed that \" red flag \" symptoms in a child should be an indication for a pediatric consultation . In the event of infection , the duration of symptoms can be reduced by promptly initiated acyclovir therapy .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by skin dryness , inflammation , and itch . A major hallmark of AD means Atopic dermatitis is an elevation of the immune cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 . These cytokines lead to skin barrier disruption and lipid abnormalities in AD means Atopic dermatitis , yet the underlying mechanisms are unclear . Sebaceous glands are specialized sebum-producing epithelial cells that promote skin barrier function by releasing lipids and antimicrobial proteins to the skin surface . Here , we show that in AD means Atopic dermatitis , IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate the expression of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 ( HSD3B1 ) , a key rate-limiting enzyme in sex steroid hormone synthesis , predominantly expressed by sebaceous glands in human skin . HSD3B1 enhances androgen production in sebocytes , and IL-4 and IL-13 drive lipid abnormalities in human sebocytes and keratinocytes through HSD3B1 . Consistent with our findings in cells , HSD3B1 expression is elevated in the skin of AD means Atopic dermatitis patients and can be restored by treatment with the IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody , Dupilumab . Androgens are also elevated in a mouse model of AD means Atopic dermatitis , though the mechanism in mice remains unclear . Our findings illuminate a connection between type 2 immunity and sex steroid hormone synthesis in the skin and suggest that abnormalities in sex steroid hormone synthesis may underlie the disrupted skin barrier in AD means Atopic dermatitis . Furthermore , targeting sex steroid hormone synthesis pathways may be a therapeutic avenue to restoring normal skin barrier function in AD means Atopic dermatitis patients .\n",
        "The involvement of interleukin (IL)-33 produced by keratinocytes has been suggested in the pathogenesis of canine atopic dermatitis ( cAD means canine atopic dermatitis ) . House dust mite (HDM)-derived proteases induce the production of various cytokines and chemokines in keratinocytes via protease-activated receptor-2 ( PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 ) ; however , their effects on IL-33 mRNA expression in canine keratinocytes have not been determined . To clarify whether HDM-derived proteases induce IL-33 mRNA expression in canine keratinocytes via PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 . Expression of IL-33 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in a cell line of canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes ( CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes ) stimulated with Dermatophagoides farinae ( Der f ) whole body extract , Der f pre-treated with cysteine protease and serine protease inhibitors , and trypsin . Trypsin and Der f-mediated IL-33 mRNA expression also was measured in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes cells treated with a PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 antagonist . Der f enhanced IL-33 mRNA expression in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes cells in incubation time- and dose-dependent manners . Der f pre-treated with a serine protease inhibitor , and not a cysteine protease inhibitor , abrogated an increase in IL-33 mRNA expression in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes cells . Trypsin also enhanced IL-33 mRNA expression in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes cells . Trypsin-mediated IL-33 mRNA expression was completely abolished by a PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 antagonist , while Der f-mediated IL-33 mRNA expression was partially and significantly diminished by it . Der f-derived serine protease upregulated IL-33 mRNA expression in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes cells at least in part via PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 . These findings suggest that HDM may be involved in the development of < sub > C</sub > AD by increasing IL-33 mRNA expression in keratinocytes .

Las proteasas derivadas de ácaros del polvo doméstico ( HDM ) inducen la producción de diversas citoquinas y quimioquinas en los queratinocitos a través del receptor 2 activado por proteasa ( PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 ) ; sin embargo , no se han determinado sus efectos sobre la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 en queratinocitos caninos . HIPÓTESIS/OBJETIVO : aclarar si las proteasas derivadas de HDM inducen la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 en queratinocitos caninos a través de PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 . MÉTODOS Y MATERIALES : se cuantificó la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 mediante PCR a tiempo real en una línea celular de progenitores de queratinocitos epidérmicos caninos ( CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes ) estimulados con extracto de cuerpo entero de Dermatophagoides farinae ( Der f ) , Der F pretratado con cisteína proteasa e inhibidores de serina proteasa , y Der F pretratado con tripsina . La expresión de RNAm de IL-33 mediada por tripsina y Der f también se midió en células CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes tratadas con un antagonista de PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 . RESULTADOS : Der f aumentó la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 en células CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes en forma dependientes del tiempo de incubación y de la dosis . El pretratamiento de Der f con un inhibidor de serina proteasa , y no con un inhibidor de cisteína proteasa , anuló el aumento en la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 en células CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes . La tripsina también incrementó la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 en células CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes . La expresión de RNAm de IL-33 mediada por tripsina fue completamente abolida por un antagonista de PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 , mientras que la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 mediada por Der f disminuyó parcial y significativamente . CONCLUSIONES Y RELEVANCIA CLÍNICA : la serina proteasa derivada de Der f incrementó la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 en células CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes al menos en parte a través de PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 . Estos hallazgos sugieren que HDM puede estar involucrado en el desarrollo de cAD means canine atopic dermatitis al aumentar la expresión de RNAm de IL-33 en queratinocitos . Eine Beteiligung von Interleukin (IL)-31 , welches von Keratinozyten produziert wird , an der Pathogenese der atopischen Dermatitis des Hundes ( cAD means canine atopic dermatitis ) , wird vermutet . Proteasen aus Hausstaubmilben ( HDM ) induzieren die Produktion verschiedener Zytokine und Chemokine in Keratinozyten über den Protease-Activated Rezeptor-2 ( PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 ) ; ihre Auswirkungen auf eine IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung in caninen Keratinozyten wurde bisher nicht bestimmt . Eine Abklärung , ob Proteasen aus HDM eine IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung in caninen Keratinozyten über PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 induzieren . Die Exprimierung von IL-33 mRNA wurde mittels Real-Time PCR in einer Zelllinie von caninen epidermalen Keratinozyten Vorläuferzellen ( CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes ) quantifiziert , die mittels Dermatophagoides farinae ( Der f ) Ganzkörperextrakt , mit Der F vorbehandelt mit Cystein Protease und Serin Protease Inhibitoren , und Der F vorbehandelt mit Trypsin stimuliert worden waren . Trypsin und Der f-mediierte IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung wurde auch in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes Zellen , die mit einem PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 Antagonisten behandelt worden waren , gemessen . Der f verstärkte die IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes Zellen Inkubationszeit- und Dosisabhängig . Der f vorbehandelt mit Serin Proteaseinhibitor , und nicht mit einem Cystein Proteaseinhibitor , verhinderte eine Zunahme an IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes Zellen . Trypsin mediierte IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung wurde durch einen PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 Antagonisten völlig verhindert , während Der f-mediierte IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung teilweise und signifikant dadurch vermindert wurde . Der f-stammend aus Serinprotease regelte IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung in CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes Zellen zumindest teilweise über PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 hoch . Diese Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin , dass HDM bei der Entwicklung von CAD durch Zunahme von IL-33 mRNA Exprimierung in Keratinozyten eine Rolle spielen könnten . 背景 : 犬アトピー性皮膚炎 ( cAD means canine atopic dermatitis ) の発症には、ケラチノサイトで産生されるインターロイキン (IL)-33の関与が示唆されている。ハウスダストマイト ( HDM ) 由来プロテアーゼは、プロテアーゼ活性化受容体-2(PAR-2 ) を介してケラチノサイトで様々なサイトカインやケモカインの産生を誘導するが、犬のケラチノサイトにおけるIL-33 mRNAの発現に対する影響は明らかにされていない 。 仮説・目的 : 本研究の目的は、HDM 由来プロテアーゼが PAR-2 means protease-activated receptor-2 を介して犬のケラチノサイトにおける IL-33 mRNA の発現を誘導するかどうかを明らかにすることであった 。 材料・方法 : Dermatophagoides farinae(Der f ) の全抽出物、システインプロテアーゼ阻害剤およびセリンプロテアーゼ阻害剤で前処理したDer F、トリプシンで前処理したDer Fで刺激した犬の前駆表皮角化細胞 ( CPEK means canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes ) において、IL-33 mRNAの発現をリアルタイムPCR法で定量した。PAR-2アンタゴニストで処理したCPEK細胞においても、トリプシンおよびDer fを介したIL-33 mRNAの発現を測定した 。 結果 : Der fはCPEK細胞のIL-33 mRNAの発現を、インキュベーション時間および用量に依存して促進した。Der fは、システインプロテアーゼ阻害剤ではなく、セリンプロテアーゼ阻害剤で前処理することにより、CPEK細胞におけるIL-33 mRNAの発現増加を無効にした。トリプシンもCPEK細胞におけるIL-33 mRNAの発現を促進した。トリプシンを介したIL-33 mRNAの発現はPAR-2アンタゴニストによって完全に消失したが、Der fを介したIL-33 mRNAの発現はPAR-2アンタゴニストによって部分的かつ有意に減少した 。 結論と臨床的妥当性 : Der f由来セリンプロテアーゼは、少なくとも部分的にはPAR-2を介してCPEK細胞のIL-33 mRNA発現を上昇させた。これらの知見は、HDMがケラチノサイトにおけるIL-33 mRNAの発現を増加させることにより、CADの発症に関与している可能性を示唆している 。 . 背景 : 角质细胞产生的白介素(IL)-33参与了犬特应性皮炎(cAD)的发病机制。屋尘螨(HDM)衍生的蛋白酶通过蛋白酶激活受体-2(PAR-2)诱导角质细胞产生各种细胞因子和趋化因子 ; 然而 , 尚未确定其对犬角质细胞中IL-33 mRNA表达的影响 。 假设/目的 : 阐明HDM衍生的蛋白酶是否通过PAR-2诱导犬角质细胞表达IL-33 mRNA 。 方法和材料 : 用粉尘螨(Der f)全身提取物、用半胱氨酸蛋白酶和丝氨酸蛋白酶抑制剂预处理的Der f , 以及用胰蛋白酶预处理的Der f刺激的犬祖细胞表皮角质细胞(CPEK)的细胞系 , 并通过实时PCR定量IL-33 mRNA的表达。在用PAR-2拮抗剂处理的CPEK细胞中也测定了胰蛋白酶和Der f介导的IL-33 mRNA表达 。 结果 : Der f以孵育时间和剂量依赖性方式增强CPEK细胞中IL-33 mRNA的表达。用丝氨酸蛋白酶抑制剂而不是半胱氨酸蛋白酶抑制剂预处理的Der f可消除CPEK细胞中IL-33 mRNA表达的增加。胰蛋白酶还可增强CPEK细胞中IL-33 mRNA的表达。PAR-2拮抗剂可完全消除胰蛋白酶介导的IL-33 mRNA表达 , 而Der f介导的IL-33 mRNA表达可部分显著减弱 。 结论和临床相关性 : Der f衍生的丝氨酸蛋白酶至少部分通过PAR-2上调CPEK细胞中IL-33 mRNA的表达。这些发现提示HDM可能通过增加角质细胞中IL-33 mRNA的表达参与CAD的发生 。 .

Die Morphologie des SC means stratum corneum war in läsionaler und offensichtlich auch in nicht-läsionaler Haut spontan atopischer Hunde verändert . 背景 : ヒトのアトピー性皮膚炎 ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) の病因は複雑である。ヒトと同様に犬もアトピー性皮膚炎を自然に発症するため、研究の有用なモデルとなりうる。しかし、犬アトピー性皮膚炎の特徴はヒトに比べてあまり明らかにされていない 。 目的 : 本研究の目的は、健常犬とアトピーを発症した犬の表皮を機能的、構造的に比較することであった 。 被験動物 : 6頭の健常ビーグル犬および5頭の実験室アトピービーグル犬 。 材料と方法 : 犬は一般的な検査、Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index , 4th iteration (CADESI-04)の評価、経皮水分蒸散量(TWEL)の測定により、臨床的に特徴づけられた。皮膚生検は、健常犬の健常皮膚、アトピー犬の非病変部および病変部の皮膚から採取した。サンプルは透過型電子顕微鏡 ( TEM means transmission electron microscopy ) で解析された。Cornified envelopeを抽出し、その外観 ( 平坦かひだがあるか ) を調べた 。 結果 : CADESI-04およびTWELはアトピー犬で有意に高かった。健常皮膚およびアトピー犬の非病変部皮膚は、病理組織学的な評価によって区別することができた。TEM検査では、アトピー皮膚の角質層 ( SC means stratum corneum ) の形態異常が認められた。SCの緻密な角質層が高くなっていた。角質細胞の厚さやしわは病変部でより顕著であり ( P = 0.005 ) 、 非病変部でもその傾向が見られた。未熟なひだ状のエンベロープの割合は、病変部と非病変部の両方のアトピーサンプルで増加していた ( P & lt ; 0.05 ) 。 結論 : 自然発症したアトピー犬の病変部と明らかに非病変部の皮膚では、SCの形態が変化していた 。 . 背景 : 人类特应性皮炎(AD)的发病机制复杂。与人类一样 , 犬也会出现自发性AD , 因此该物种可能是有用的研究模型。然而 , 犬中的AD特征少于人 。 目的 : 在功能和结构水平上 , 比较正常和自发性特应性犬的表皮 。 动物 : 6只健康和5只特应性实验室比格犬 。 方法和材料 : 通过全身检查、犬特应性皮炎程度和严重指数、第4版(CADESI-04)评价和经表皮水分流失(TWEL)测量对犬进行临床表征。从正常犬的健康皮肤以及特应性犬的非病变和病变皮肤上进行皮肤活检。使用透射电子显微镜(TEM)分析样品。提取角化包膜并检查其外观 ( 平滑与褶皱 ) 。 结果 : CADESI-04和TWEL在特应性犬中显著较高。通过组织病理学评估可区分健康和非病变皮肤与病变皮肤。TEM检查发现特应性皮肤角质层(SC)形态异常。SC角化细胞层的压实程度较高。较厚和起皱的角化细胞在病变中更明显(P = 0.005 ) , 在非病变中也有此倾向。特应性样本中未成熟皱褶包膜的比例增加(P & lt ; 0.05 ) , 无论是病变区还是非病变区 。 结论 : 自发性特应性犬的病变和明显非病变皮肤中SC的形态发生了改变 。 . A patogênese da dermatite atópica humana ( DA means dermatite atópica humana ) é complexa . Como seres humanos , os cães desenvolvem DA means dermatite atópica humana espontaneamente o que torna esta espécie um modelo útil de estudo . No entanto , DA means dermatite atópica humana foi tem sido menos caracterizada em cães do que em humanos . Comparar a epiderme de cães normais e espontaneamente atópicos nos níveis funcional e estrutural . Seis cães de Beagle de laboratório saudáveis e cinco atópicos . MÉTODOS E MATERIAIS : Os cães foram avaliados clinicamente pelo exame geral , da extensão da dermatite atópica canina e índice de gravidade , 4ª iteração ( Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index , 4<sup > th</sup > iteration CADESI-04 ) e perda de água transepidérmica ( TEWL means transepidermalen Wasserverlusts ) . Biópsias de pele foram coletadas de pele saudável de cães normais e na pele não-lesional e lesional de cães atópicos . As amostras foram analisadas usando microscopia eletrônica de transmissão ( MET means microscopia eletrônica de transmissão ) . Os envelopes cornificados foram extraídos e examinados para seus aspectos visuais ( lisos versus rugosos ) . CADESI-04 e TEWL means transepidermalen Wasserverlusts foram significativamente maiores em cães atópicos . A pele saudável e não-lesional pode ser diferenciada da pele lesional pela avaliação histopatológica . As análises por MET means microscopia eletrônica de transmissão revelaram morfologia anormal do estrato córneo ( SC means stratum corneum ) na pele atópica . A camada de cormeócitos compactos do SC means stratum corneum foi maior . Corneócitos mais espessos e rugosos estavam mais proeminentes ( p = 0,005 ) na pele lesional e tendiam a ser assim também na pele não-lesional . A proporção de envelopes rugosos imaturos estava aumentada em amostras de atópicos ( p & lt;0,05 ) , tanto das áreas lesionais quanto nas não-lesionais . CONCLUSÕES : A morfologia do SC means stratum corneum apresentou-se alterada na pele lesional e aparentemente não-lesional de cães espontaneamente atópicos .\n",
        "A defective skin barrier occurs in dogs with atopic dermatitis , and there is controversy over whether this defect pre-exists , or is secondary to allergic inflammation . To study if an allergen challenge decreases the natural moisturising factor ( NMF means natural moisturising factor ) , which contains the main filaggrin degradation products . Four house dust mite (HDM)-sensitised adult atopic dogs from a research colony . Dogs were challenged epicutaneously with HDMs on the right lateral abdomen while the left thorax served as control . We swabbed the skin surface before , and at days (D)1 , D2 , D3 , D7 and D28 after challenge , on both selected sites ; swabs were soaked in detergent and frozen until assayed . The NMF means natural moisturising factor components were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS-MS means Los componentes de NMF se midieron mediante cromatografía líquida-espectrometría de masas en tándem ) . The allergen challenge induced moderate skin lesions at the application sites , and also mild erythema at the control areas . The allergen provocation led to significant decreases in the total NMF means natural moisturising factor and its components trans-urocanic acid means acid (PCA ( t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid ) , pyrrolidone carboxylic acid means acid (PCA ( PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid ) and serine on both sites . Lesion scores abated by D7 and the NMF means natural moisturising factor concentrations had re-increased by D28 . Skin lesion scores correlated negatively with the total NMF means natural moisturising factor , t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid and PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid concentrations . In this experimental model , a single epicutaneous allergen challenge led to a transient and reversible decrease in skin surface NMF means natural moisturising factor and its components , and concentrations were negatively correlated with skin lesion scores . These observations suggest that some of the skin barrier anomalies seen in atopic dogs likely develop secondarily to the underlying cutaneous allergic inflammation . Un défaut de barrière cutanée existe chez le chien atopique et il y a controverse si ce défaut préexiste ou s’il est secondaire � une inflammation allergique . Etudier si une provocation allergénique diminue le NMF means natural moisturising factor ( natural moisturising factor ) qui contient les principaux produits de dégradation de la filaggrine . Quatre chiens atopiques sensibilisés aux acariens de poussière de maison ( HDM ) d’une colonie de recherche . MÉTHODES : Les chiens ont été provoqués par test épicutanés avec HDMs sur l’abdomen latéral droit pendant que le thorax gauche servait de contrôle . Nous avons prélevés la surface de la peau avant et après provocation � D1 , D2 , D3 , D7 et D28 sur les deux faces sélectionnées ; les écouvillons ont été trempés dans un détergent et congelés jusqu’aux tests . Les composés NMF means natural moisturising factor ont été mesurés par LC/MS-MS means Los componentes de NMF se midieron mediante cromatografía líquida-espectrometría de masas en tándem ( liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ) . RÉSULTATS : La provocation allergénique a induit des lésions modérées aux sites d’application , et aussi un érythème modéré aux zones contrôles . Le test de provocation � mené � des diminutions significatives du NMF means natural moisturising factor total et ses composés t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid ( trans-urocanic acid means acid (PCA ) , PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid ( pyrrolidone carboxylic acid means acid (PCA ) et sérine sur les deux sites . Les scores lésionnels se calmaient � D7 et les concentrations de NMF means natural moisturising factor ré-augmentaient � D28 . Les scores de lésions cutanées corrélaient négativement avec les concentrations de NMF means natural moisturising factor total , t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid et PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid . Dans ce modèle expérimental , un test allergénique epicutané unique mène � une diminution réversible et transitoire de NMF means natural moisturising factor de la surface cutanée et de ses composés et les concentrations sont négativement corrélées avec les scores de lésion cutanée . Ces observations suggèrent que certaines des anomalies de barrière cutanée observées chez les chiens atopiques pourraient se développer secondairement � l’inflammation cutanée allergique sous jacente . INTRODUCCIÓN : en perros con dermatitis atópica se observa una barrera cutánea defectuosa , y existe controversia sobre si este defecto existe antes o es secundario a la inflamación alérgica . OBJETIVOS : Estudiar si una exposición con alérgenos disminuye el factor de hidratación natural ( NMF means natural moisturising factor ) , que contiene los principales productos de degradación de la filagrina . ANIMALES : cuatro perros adultos atópicos sensibilizados contra los ácaros del polvo doméstico ( HDM ) de una colonia de investigación . MÉTODOS : los perros fueron expuestos epicutáneamente con HDM en el abdomen lateral derecho mientras que el tórax izquierdo sirvió como control . Limpiamos la superficie de la piel antes y en los días ( D ) 1 , D2 , D3 , D7 y D28 después de la exposición , en ambos sitios seleccionados ; los hisopos se empaparon en detergente y se congelaron hasta su análisis . Los componentes de NMF means natural moisturising factor se midieron mediante cromatografía líquida-espectrometría de masas en tándem ( LC/MS-MS means Los componentes de NMF se midieron mediante cromatografía líquida-espectrometría de masas en tándem ) . RESULTADOS : la exposición al alérgeno indujo lesiones cutáneas moderadas en los lugares de aplicación y también eritema leve en las áreas de control . La provocación del alérgeno condujo a disminuciones significativas en el NMF means natural moisturising factor total y en sus componentes ácido transurocánico ( t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid ) , ácido pirrolidona carboxílico ( PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid ) y serina en ambos sitios . Las puntuaciones de las lesiones disminuyeron al D7 y las concentraciones de NMF means natural moisturising factor habían vuelto a aumentar en el D28 . Las puntuaciones de las lesiones cutáneas se correlacionaron negativamente con las concentraciones totales de NMF means natural moisturising factor , t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid y PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid . CONCLUSIONES E IMPORTANCIA CLÍNICA : en este modelo experimental , una sola exposición a alérgeno epicutáneo condujo a una disminución transitoria y reversible en el NMF means natural moisturising factor de la superficie de la piel y sus componentes , y las concentraciones se correlacionaron negativamente con las puntuaciones de las lesiones cutáneas . Estas observaciones sugieren que algunas de las anomalías de la barrera cutánea observadas en perros atópicos probablemente se desarrollen de forma secundaria a la inflamación alérgica cutánea subyacente . Bei Hunden mit atopischer Dermatitis besteht eine defekte Hautbarriere und es besteht eine Kontroverse darüber , ob dieser Defekt wirklich vor-existiert oder ob er sekundär durch die allergische Entzündung verursacht wird . Es sollte untersucht werden , ob eine Provokation mit dem Allergen den natürlichen Feuchthalte-Faktor ( NMF means natural moisturising factor ) , der die hauptsächlichen Abbauprodukte von Filaggrin enthält , reduziert . Vier erwachsene atopische Hunde aus einer Forschungskolonie , die mit Hausstaubmilben ( HDM ) sensibilisiert worden waren . Die Hunde wurden epikutan mit den HDMs rechts lateral am Abdomen provoziert , während der linke Thorax als Kontrolle diente . Wir entnahmen vorher und an den Tagen ( D ) 1 , D2 , D3 , D7 und D28 nach der Provokation von beiden ausgewählten Seiten Tupferproben ; die Tupfer wurden in Detergens getränkt und bis zur Untersuchung eingefroren . Die NMF means natural moisturising factor Komponenten wurden mittels Hochleistungsflüssigkeitschromatografie Tandem Massenspektrometrie ( LC/MS-MS means Los componentes de NMF se midieron mediante cromatografía líquida-espectrometría de masas en tándem ) gemessen . Die Allergen Provokation induzierte moderate Hautveränderungen an den Applikationsstellen , sowie ein mildes Erythem an den Kontrollstellen . Die Allergen Provokation führte auf beiden Seiten zu signifikanten Abnahmen der totalen NMF means natural moisturising factor und seiner Komponenten Trans-Urocaninsäure ( t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid ) , Pyrrolidoncarbonsäure ( PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid ) und Serin . Die Läsionswerte nahmen mit D7 ab und die NMF means natural moisturising factor Konzentrationen hatten mit D28 wieder zugenommen . Die Werte der Hautläsionen korrelierten negativ mit den Gesamt NMF means natural moisturising factor , t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid und PVA Konzentrationen . In diesem experimentellen Modell führt eine einzige epikutane Allergenprovokation zu einer vorübergehenden und reversiblen Zunahme der NMF means natural moisturising factor der Hautoberfläche und seiner Komponenten , die Konzentrationen waren mit den Hautwerten negativ korreliert . Diese Beobachtungen weisen darauf hin , dass einige der Anomalien der Hautbarriere , die bei atopischen Hunden gesehen werden , sich sekundär aufgrund der zugrundeliegenden allergischen Hautentzündung entwickeln . 背景 : アトピー性皮膚炎の犬では皮膚バリアの欠損が見られるが、この欠損が以前から存在していたのか、あるいはアレルギー性炎症に二次的に生じたものなのかについては議論が分かれている 。 目的 : 本研究の目的は、アレルゲン負荷が、主なフィラグリン分解産物を含む天然保湿因子 ( NMF means natural moisturising factor ) を減少させるかどうかを研究することであった 。 被験動物 : 研究用コロニーのハウスダストマイト ( HDM ) 感作アトピー成犬4頭 。 方法 : 犬の右側腹部にHDMを付着させ、左胸部はコントロールとした。負荷前、負荷後1日目、2日目、3日目、7日目、28日目に、選択した両部位の皮膚表面を綿棒で採取し、綿棒は洗剤に浸して測定するまで凍結させた。NMFの成分は、液体クロマトグラフィー・タンデム質量解析法 ( LC/MS-MS means Los componentes de NMF se midieron mediante cromatografía líquida-espectrometría de masas en tándem ) で測定した 。 結果 : アレルゲン負荷は、塗布部位に中程度の皮膚病を誘発し、コントロール部位にも軽度の紅斑が見られた。アレルゲンの誘発により、両部位のNMFおよびその成分であるtrans-urocanic acid means acid (PCA (t-UCA)、pyrrolidone carboxylic acid means acid (PCA (PCA)、serineが有意に減少した。皮膚病変のスコアはD7までに減少し、NMFの濃度はD28までに再び上昇した。皮膚病変のスコアは、NMF、t-UCAおよびPCAの合計濃度と負の相関があった 。 結論と臨床上の重要性 : この実験モデルでは、アレルゲンの単回外皮投与により、皮膚表面のNMFとその成分が一過性かつ可逆的に減少し、その濃度は皮膚病変のスコアと負の相関を示した。これらの観察結果は、アトピー犬に見られる皮膚バリアの異常のいくつかは、根底にある皮膚のアレルギー性炎症に続いて発症する可能性が高いことを示唆している 。 . 背景 : 特应性皮炎犬的皮肤屏障存在缺陷 , 对于该缺陷是预先存在还是继发于过敏性炎症存在争议 。 目的 : 研究过敏原激发是否会降低含有主要丝聚蛋白降解产物的天然保湿因子(NMF ) 。 动物 : 来自一个研究种群的4只屋尘螨(HDM)致敏的成年特应性犬 。 方法 : 在犬右侧腹部用HDM进行皮外激发 , 同时左胸作为对照。我们在激发前和激发后第(D)1、D2、D3、D7和D28天 , 在两个选定部位擦拭皮肤表面 ; 将拭子浸泡在洗涤剂中并冷冻直至测定。通过液相色谱-串联质谱法(LC/MS-MS)测定NMF组分 。 结果 : 过敏原激发在用药部位引起中度皮肤病变 , 在对照区域也引起轻度红斑。过敏原激发导致两个位点的总NMF及其组分反式尿烷酸(t-UCA)、吡咯烷酮羧酸(PCA)和丝氨酸显著降低。病变评分在D7时减轻 , NMF浓度在D28时重新增加。皮肤病变评分与总NMF、t-UCA和PCA浓度呈负相关 。 结论和临床重要性 : 在该实验模型中 , 单次表皮过敏原激发导致皮肤表面NMF及其组分一过性和可逆性降低 , 且浓度与皮肤病变评分呈负相关。这些观察结果表明 , 在特应性犬中观察到的一些皮肤屏障异常可能继发于潜在的皮肤过敏炎症 。 .

Os escores de lesão diminuíram no D7 e as concentrações de NMF means natural moisturising factor aumentaram novamente no D28 . Os escores de lesão de pele correlacionaram negativamente com as concentrações de NMF means natural moisturising factor total , t-UCA means trans-urocanic acid e PCA means pyrrolidone carboxylic acid . CONCLUSÕES E IMPORTÂNCIA CLÍNICA : Neste modelo experimental , um único desafio de alergênico epicutâneo levou a uma redução transitória e reversível NMF means natural moisturising factor superficial e seus componentes , e as concentrações foram negativamente correlacionadas com as pontuações da lesão da pele . Essas observações sugerem que algumas das anomalias de barreira da pele observadas em cães atópicos provavelmente se desenvolvem secundariamente � inflamação alérgica cutânea subjacente .\n",
        "During the past years , there has been a global outbreak of allergic diseases , presenting a considerable medical and socioeconomical burden . A large fraction of allergic diseases is characterized by a type 2 immune response involving Th2 cells , type 2 innate lymphoid cells , eosinophils , mast cells , and M2 macrophages . Biomarkers are valuable parameters for precision medicine as they provide information on the disease endotypes , clusters , precision diagnoses , identification of therapeutic targets , and monitoring of treatment efficacies . The availability of powerful omics technologies , together with integrated data analysis and network-based approaches can help the identification of clinically useful biomarkers . These biomarkers need to be accurately quantified using robust and reproducible methods , such as reliable and point-of-care systems . Ideally , samples should be collected using quick , cost-efficient and noninvasive methods . In recent years , a plethora of research has been directed toward finding novel biomarkers of allergic diseases . Promising biomarkers of type 2 allergic diseases include sputum eosinophils , serum periostin and exhaled nitric oxide . Several other biomarkers , such as pro-inflammatory mediators , miRNAs , eicosanoid molecules , epithelial barrier integrity , and microbiota changes are useful for diagnosis and monitoring of allergic diseases and can be quantified in serum , body fluids and exhaled air . Herein , we review recent studies on biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma , chronic urticaria , atopic dermatitis , allergic rhinitis , chronic rhinosinusitis , food allergies , anaphylaxis , drug hypersensitivity and allergen immunotherapy . In addition , we discuss COVID-19 and allergic diseases within the perspective of biomarkers and recommendations on the management of allergic and asthmatic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic .\n",
        "The aim of this study was to detect demographic and clinical factors associated with affective symptoms and quality of life in patients with severe atopic dermatitis . First , one-way analyses of variance and correlations were performed to compare a large set of qualitative and quantitative clinical variables . Three final multivariable regression models were performed , with depression/anxiety subscales and Dermatology Life Quality Index scores as dependent variables , and the factors that were statistically significant on univariate analyses as independent ones . More severe anxiety symptoms and poorer quality of life ( p & lt ; 0.01 ) were significantly associated with more severe depressive symptoms . Female sex and disturbed sleep ( p = 0.03 ) were significantly associated with more severe anxiety . Finally , previous treatment with cyclosporine ( p = 0.03 ) or methotrexate ( p = 0.04 ) , more severe depressive symptoms ( p & lt ; 0.01 ) , itch ( p = 0.03 ) , impaired sleep ( p & lt ; 0.01 ) and perceived severity of dermatological illness ( p & lt ; 0.01 ) were significant predictors of low quality of life . This study shows a complex interplay between the severity of atopic dermatitis , poor quality of life and presence of clinically relevant affective symptoms . These results will help dermatologists to identify patients who need psychiatric consultation within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach .\n",
        "High-quality dermatology patient registries often require considerable time to develop and produce meaningful data . Development time is influenced by registry complexity and regulatory hurdles that vary significantly nationally and institutionally . The rapid emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 ) global pandemic has challenged health services in an unprecedented manner . Mobilization of the dermatology community in response has included rapid development and deployment of multiple , partially harmonized , international patient registries , reinventing established patient registry timelines . Partnership with patient organizations has demonstrated the critical nature of inclusive patient involvement . This global effort has demonstrated the value , capacity , and necessity for the dermatology community to adopt a more cohesive approach to patient registry development and data sharing that can lead to myriad benefits . These include improved utilization of limited resources , increased data interoperability , improved ability to rapidly collect meaningful data , and shortened response times to generate real-world evidence . We call on the global dermatology community to support the development of an international federation of patient registries to consolidate and operationalize the lessons learned during this pandemic . This will provide an enduring means of applying this knowledge to the maintenance and development of sustainable , coherent , and impactful patient registries of benefit now and in the future .\n",
        "Italy was among the world 's earliest and most affected countries by coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 ) . We report the Italian experience with the pandemic . The dermatologic community immediately reduced any type of activities to 80 % to 90 % of outpatient consultations , both in public hospitals and in private offices . The Italian Society of Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases and the Italian Forensic Dermatologic Society supported the dermatologic community by reporting recommendations in newsletters ( vademecum ) regarding the routine management of dermatologic patients either in the hospital or private setting . We have provided an overview of the skin manifestations from the pandemic , including the consequences of the misuse of safety measures . We also have evaluated the recently developed research projects on patients treated with biologics for psoriasis , atopic dermatitis , and hidradenitis suppurativa , as well as on the registries regarding various skin diseases affected by COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is associated with substantial financial cost , including increased out-of-pocket ( OOP means out-of-pocket ) expenses . Associations and impact of OOP means out-of-pocket costs are poorly understood . The aim of the study was to characterize the impact and associations of OOP means out-of-pocket health care expenses for AD means Atopic dermatitis . A 25-question online survey was administered to National Eczema Association members ( N = 113,502 ) . Inclusion criteria ( US residents aged ≥18 years ; self-reported AD means Atopic dermatitis or primary caregiver of individual with AD means Atopic dermatitis ) were met by 77.3 % ( 1118 of 1447 ) . Respondents with monthly OOP means out-of-pocket expenses greater than $ 200 were more likely to have increased AD means Atopic dermatitis severity , flares , health care provider visits , prescription polypharmacy , use of step-up therapy , frequent skin infections , and poorer disease control ( P & lt ; 0.005 for all ) .

        "< i > Staphylococcus aureus</i > is a skin commensal microorganism commonly colonizing healthy humans . Nevertheless , < i > S. aureus</i > can also be responsible for cutaneous infections and contribute to flare-up of inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , which is characterized by dysbiosis of the skin microbiota with < i > S. aureus</i > as the predominant species . However , the role of major virulence factors of this pathogen such as phenol-soluble modulin ( PSM means phenol-soluble modulin ) toxins in epidermal inflammation remains poorly understood . Stimulation of primary human keratinocytes with sublytic concentrations of synthetic and purified PSM means phenol-soluble modulin α3 resulted in upregulation of a large panel of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine gene expression , including CXCL1 , CXCL2 , CXCL3 , CXCL5 , CXCL8 , CCL20 , IL-1α , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-36γ and TNF-α , while inducing the release of CXCL8 , CCL20 , TNF-α and IL-6 . In addition , using < i > S. aureus</i > culture supernatant from mutants deleted from genes encoding either α-type PSMs or all PSM means phenol-soluble modulin production , PSMs were shown to be the main factors of < i > S. aureus</i > secretome responsible for pro-inflammatory mediator induction in human keratinocytes . On the other hand , α-type PSM-containing supernatant triggered an intense induction of pro-inflammatory mediator expression and secretion during both topical and basal layer stimulation of an < i > ex vivo</i > model of human skin explants , a physiologically relevant model of pluristratified epidermis . Taken together , the results of this study show that PSMs and more specifically α-type PSMs are major virulence factors of < i > S. aureus</i > inducing a potent inflammatory response during infection of the human epidermis and could thereby contribute to AD means atopic dermatitis flare-up through exacerbation of skin inflammation .\n",
        "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine medical care may result in altered healthcare resource use in patients with immune-mediated conditions . The aim of this study was to determine the impact of treatment interruptions in patients with and without COVID-19 infections who were treated with targeted immunomodulators ( TIMs means targeted immunomodulators ) in the USA . Data from the IBM < sup> ® </sup > MarketScan < sup> ® </sup > Research Databases were analyzed in patients with immune-mediated conditions from January 1 , 2018 , through December 31 , 2020 . Healthcare resource use ( HCRU means Healthcare resource use ) including hospitalizations , emergency department ( ED means emergency department ) visits , in-person outpatient visits , and respiratory outcomes was assessed in a cohort of patients without COVID-19 who had uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use . The impact of treatment interruption on HCRU means Healthcare resource use and respiratory outcomes was also evaluated in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 . Results from adjusted logistic regression were reported as adjusted odds ratios ( aORs means adjusted odds ratios ) with 95 % confidence intervals . Approximately 25 % of patients in both the COVID-19 ( N = 787 ) and non-COVID-19 cohorts ( N = 77,178 ) experienced interruptions in TIM therapy . In the non-COVID-19 cohort , the likelihood of being hospitalized was 20 % less in patients with uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use ( aOR = 0.80 , 95 % CI 0.71 - 0.90 ) . Patients with uninterrupted TIM use had a similar likelihood of an ED means emergency department visit ( aOR = 0.99 , 95 % CI 0.91 - 1.08 ) and respiratory outcome ( aOR = 0.97 , 95 % CI 0.71 - 1.31 ) versus patients with interrupted TIM use . The likelihood of having an in-person outpatient visit was 87 % greater in patients with uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use ( aOR = 1.87 , 95 % CI 1.81 - 1.94 ) . Similar findings were observed in the COVID-19 cohort . This analysis of real-world claims data showed that uninterrupted TIM use was not associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalizations , ED means emergency department visits , or negative respiratory outcomes compared to interrupted TIM use among patients with immune-mediated conditions , regardless of COVID-19 diagnosis .\n",
        "Dupilumab is highly effective in treating atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) .

This is a retrospective cohort study of children on dupilumab for AD means atopic dermatitis . Collected variables included patient demographics , medical histories , and dupilumab therapy characteristics . Response analysis was conducted in those with ≥3 months of dupilumab therapy : primary poor responders were defined as those whose EASI scores did not decrease by & gt;50 % , and secondary poor responders were those who initially responded but had significant AD means atopic dermatitis flares while on therapy . We included 200 patients on dupilumab for AD means atopic dermatitis in our cohort ; 192 received ≥3 months of therapy and were included in our response analysis . Twelve children experienced inadequate primary response , and 4 were secondary poor responders . Four of these 16 children discontinued therapy due to inadequate response . The most common dupilumab-associated AEs means adverse events were facial erythema ( n = 24 , 12.0 % ) and injection-site reactions ( n = 24 , 12.0 % ) . Female sex was significantly associated with experiencing injection-site reactions , and prior hospitalization was significantly associated with HSV infection on dupilumab . Eight patients discontinued therapy due to an AE . A small but significant number of patients experienced treatment difficulties while on dupilumab . The risk of inadequate response to dupilumab and dupilumab-associated AEs means adverse events should be discussed thoroughly with patients and their families prior to initiation .\n",
        "The prevalence and impact of pruritus , pain , and other sensory symptoms in skin diseases are poorly known . To assess the frequency of these symptoms with dermatoses and their association with depression using data from the \" Objectifs Peau \" survey . A representative sample of 20,012 French individuals was created using the usual quota method . When patients suffered from both pruritus and skin pain , they had a higher relative risk of psychological suffering ( 2.9 ) than those who suffered only from pruritus ( 1.4 ) or skin pain ( 1.2 ) . Pruritus was reported in 48.55 % of patients with acne , 43.24 % with mycoses , 44.35 % with warts , and 36.51 % with rosacea . For skin pain , the results were 11.22 % , 27.59 % , and 16.13 % for atopic dermatitis , acne , and warts , respectively . Other unpleasant sensations , such as tingling or burning , were also frequently reported . Pruritus , pain , or other sensory symptoms were found to be common not only in classic pruritic skin diseases but also in acne , rosacea , or warts . The association of pruritus and pain dramatically increased psychological suffering . These symptoms must be systematically searched for in patients , especially since new therapeutic possibilities are emerging for the symptomatic treatment of pruritus .\n",
        "To identify the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 disease in Oman . The study was conducted in two phases with initial cross-sectional data collection with subsequent telemedical investigations of late skin manifestations including confirmed COVID-19 patients evaluated at Al-Nahdha Hospital and local health centers in Muscat from March 22 to June 2 , 2020 . The total number of patients included in the study was 374 . Cutaneous manifestations were observed in 1.87 % ( n=7 ) of patients at presentation with an additional 1.6 % ( n=5 ) on follow-up . The types of skin reactions included maculopapular rash ( n=6 ) , urticaria ( n=2 ) , transient pruritic erythema means erythema (n=1 ( n=1 ) , pruritic palmoplantar erythema means erythema (n=1 ( n=1 ) , pustular eruption ( n=1 ) and flare-up of atopic dermatitis ( n=1 ) . The low percentage of skin lesions is not contradicting previous data and it might just reflect under-reporting of skin rash in the context of the presence of more severe symptoms in our sample population . Skin lesions can still be utilized to treat patients as suspected cases until proven otherwise as it can be a silent clue in asymptomatic patients .\n",
        "Matricellular proteins are involved in the crosstalk between cells and their environment and thus play an important role in allergic and inflammatory reactions . Periostin , a matricellular protein , has several documented and multi-faceted roles in health and disease . It is differentially expressed , usually upregulated , in allergic conditions , a variety of inflammatory diseases as well as in cancer and contributes to the development and progression of these diseases . Periostin has also been shown to influence tissue remodelling , fibrosis , regeneration and repair . In allergic reactions periostin is involved in type 2 immunity and can be induced by IL-4 and IL-13 in bronchial cells . A variety of different allergic diseases , among them bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , have been shown to be connected to periostin expression . Periostin is commonly expressed in fibroblasts and acts on epithelial cells as well as fibroblasts involving integrin and NF-κB signalling . Also direct signalling between periostin and immune cells has been reported . The deposition of periostin in inflamed , often fibrotic , tissues is further fuelling the inflammatory process . There is increasing evidence that periostin is also expressed by epithelial cells in several of the above-mentioned conditions as well as in cancer . Augmented periostin expression has also been associated with chronic inflammation such as in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD means inflammatory bowel disease ) . Periostin can be expressed in a variety of different isoforms , whose functions have not been elucidated yet . This review will discuss potential functions of periostin and its different isoforms in allergy and inflammation .\n",
        "The role of type 2 inflammation in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases is an area of active investigation . Certain asthma , atopic dermatitis , eosinophilic esophagitis , and chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypes are characterized by a Th2 predominant inflammatory pathway and are frequently associated with comorbid conditions in patients . The purpose of this article is to review the evidence behind concurrent Th2-mediated diseases and explore how the presence of these comorbid conditions affect patient and disease outcomes .\n",
        "The prevalence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) has increased , but studies in adult or elderly populations are sparse . We investigated 12-month and lifetime prevalences of AD means atopic dermatitis in the Finnish adult population ≥30 years of age and analyzed living environment factors , socioeconomic factors , lifestyle-related factors , and serum vitamin D levels for their associations with AD means atopic dermatitis in a national health examination survey . The lifetime prevalence was 21.9 % and 12-month prevalence 10.1 % . The highest prevalence ( lifetime 28.6 % , 12-month 15.4 % ) was seen in subjects 30 - 39 years of age . Prevalence decreased with age . Subjects with highly educated parents were more likely to have active AD means atopic dermatitis , though there was no effect of higher education in subjects themselves . Younger age and being an ex-smoker were associated with active AD means atopic dermatitis . Female sex and daily smoking increased the risk in subjects 30 - 49 years of age . There was no dose-response relationship to serum vitamin D levels and no association with the living environment . Our data show that the number of adult patients with atopic dermatitis has grown and prevalence numbers of AD means atopic dermatitis in Finnish adults are among the highest reported . Together with the aging of the society , the burden of AD means atopic dermatitis is not limited to childhood .\n",
        "Dupilumab is approved to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in several countries in patients as young as 6 years of age . Since its approval , practical issues related to the use of dupilumab for AD means atopic dermatitis have arisen , with particular interest in transitioning from current therapies and managing medication overlap , considerations for special populations of patients with AD means atopic dermatitis , and management of potential adverse events . This article aims to review the literature addressing several practical management issues related to dupilumab use for AD means atopic dermatitis and to provide a framework for clinical decision-making in these circumstances and sub-populations . Each statement was reviewed , revised and voted on by authors to provide their level of agreement and degree of uncertainty for each statement . An agreement level & gt ; 80 % was achieved for all of the statements . The expert panel provides statements considering the practical management of patients with AD means atopic dermatitis taking dupilumab to inform clinical decision-making in specific but frequently encountered clinical situations .\n",
        "Orengedokuto ( OGT means Orengedokuto ) is a Kampo prescription that has been used for the treatment of inflammation , hypertension , gastrointestinal disorders , and liver and cerebrovascular diseases . It is also used for the treatment of skin diseases such as urticaria and atopic dermatitis . We previously studied its anti-allergic effects of OGT means Orengedokuto on the murine model of 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB)-induced contact hypersensitivity ( CHS means contact hypersensitivity ) and demonstrated that it significantly suppresses ear swelling in a dose-dependent manner . However , the mechanism underlying this activity remained unknown . Here , we sought to identify the mechanism involved . Using a murine model of TNCB-induced CHS means contact hypersensitivity , together with adoptive cell transfer experiments , we found that the anti-allergic effects of OGT means Orengedokuto may be due to the inhibition of effector T cell activation and not the induction and/or activation of regulatory T cells . Flow cytometry analysis revealed that oral administration of OGT means Orengedokuto suppressed the increase in CD8<sup>+</sup > CD44<sup > high</sup > CD62L < sup>+</sup > cell number in draining lymph nodes ( dLNs means draining lymph nodes ) of mice sensitized with 5 % TNCB . Additionally , ex vivo experiments confirmed the suppressive effect of OGT means Orengedokuto on the activation of effector T cells , as interferon-γ ( IFN-γ means interferon-γ ) production by cultured lymphocytes obtained from 5 % TNCB-sensitized mice and stimulated with anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies was reduced by OGT means Orengedokuto administration . In conclusion , our finding suggests that OGT means Orengedokuto exerts anti-allergic effects by regulating the activation of effector T cells involved in inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "The concept of atopy was initially developed in the first quarter of the 20th century on the basis of clinical observations without any knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms . Atopy involves a collection of comorbidities that share pathogenic features , and atopic comorbidities affect outcomes of concomitant conditions rather than existing synchronously . The clinical importance of understanding the relationship of these conditions is necessary because the treatment of one condition influences the others , and the development of one leads to or precedes the development of another . Environmental influences and multigenetic predispositions result in complex relationships among the atopic conditions sharing a type 2 pathogenesis . The specialty of Allergy and Immunology is devoted to managing the comorbidities of atopy , and better understanding of their connections can improve patient care .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic pruritic skin disorder that affects up to 20 % of children and 10 % of adults . The disease course is unpredictable with periods of exacerbation and remission , thus having a significant impact on the mental health and quality of life ( QOL means quality of life ) . We evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and depression and their association with disease severity , QOL means quality of life and their associated factors in adolescents ( ≥ 13 years old ) and adults with AD means Atopic dermatitis . A cross-sectional study was conducted involving patients aged ≥ 13 years with AD means Atopic dermatitis who fulfilled the Hanifin and Rajka diagnostic criteria . These patients were recruited from Hospital Queen Elizabeth , Kota Kinabalu and Hospital Kuala Lumpur between January 2020 to March 2021 . Assessment instruments used were Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD means Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis ) , Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure ( POEM means Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure ) , Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index ) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS means Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ) . Of the 217 participants , 75 ( 34.6 % ) had mild eczema , 116 ( 53.5 % ) moderate eczema and 26 ( 12.0 % ) severe eczema with a mean SCORAD means Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis score of 30.4 ( standard deviation [ SD ] = 4.70 ) . Twenty-six ( 12.0 % ) and 17 ( 7.8 % ) had anxiety and depression , respectively . Patients with moderate to severe disease reported higher HADS-A means HADS-D (HADS-depression component ( HADS-anxiety component ) , HADS-D ( HADS-depression component ) , POEM means Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure , DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index , itch , sleep loss and skin pain scores ( p & lt ; 0.001 for all ) . Severe sleep loss ( adjusted odd ratio [ AOR ] 12.41 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) and hospitalisation in the past year ( AOR 6.44 , p = 0.004 ) were significant predictors for anxiety whereas those aged 41 to 60 ( AOR 10.83 , p = 0.020 ) , having severe skin pain ( AOR 6.12 , p = 0.028 ) , DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index ≥ 10 ( AOR 5.27 , p = 0.002 ) and history of hospitalisation in the past year ( AOR 12.73 , p = 0.002 ) had increased risk for depression . The prevalence of anxiety was 12.0 % while depression was 7.8 % in our cohort . AD means Atopic dermatitis renders a significant burden on mental health and QOL means quality of life with a higher impact on those with more severe disease . The use of screening tools such as HADS means Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index for assessment of mental health and QOL means quality of life should be considered to address the multidimensional burden of AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "This study presents the first application of convolutional neural networks to high-frequency ultrasound skin image classification . This type of imaging opens up new opportunities in dermatology , showing inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis , psoriasis , or skin lesions . We collected a database of 631 images with healthy skin and different skin pathologies to train and assess all stages of the methodology . The proposed framework starts with the segmentation of the epidermal layer using a DeepLab v3 + model with a pre-trained Xception backbone . We employ transfer learning to train the segmentation model for two purposes : to extract the region of interest for classification and to prepare the skin layer map for classification confidence estimation . For classification , we train five models in different input data modes and data augmentation setups . We also introduce a classification confidence level to evaluate the deep model 's reliability . The measure combines our skin layer map with the heatmap produced by the Grad-CAM technique designed to indicate image regions used by the deep model to make a classification decision . Moreover , we propose a multicriteria model evaluation measure to select the optimal model in terms of classification accuracy , confidence , and test dataset size . The experiments described in the paper show that the DenseNet-201 model fed with the extracted region of interest produces the most reliable and accurate results .\n",
        "< i > Artemisia anomala</i > S. Moore is a perennial herbaceous plant classified as Asteraceae of the genus Artemisia . Many species of < i > Artemisia</i > have been used as medicinal materials . < i > Artemisia anomala</i > S. Moore has been widely used in China to treat inflammatory diseases . However , the mechanism of its action on the keratinocyte inflammatory response is poorly understood . Here , we investigated the anti-inflammatory reaction of < i > Artemisia anomala</i > S. Moore ethanol extract ( EAA means ethanol extract ) using human keratinocyte ( HaCaT ) cells , which involved investigating the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) , signal transducer , and activator of transcription-1 ( STAT-1 means signal transducer, and activator of transcription-1 ) , as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK means mitogen-activated protein kinase ) signaling pathways and atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in mice . We elucidated the anti-inflammatory effects of EAA means ethanol extract on tumor necrosis factor-α/interferon-γ (TNF-α/IFN-γ)-treated human keratinocyte cells and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis (AD)-like mice . The levels of chemokines and cytokines ( IL-8 , IL-6 , TARC , and RANTES ) were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . The NF-κB , STAT-1 means signal transducer, and activator of transcription-1 , and MAPK means mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in HaCaT cells were analyzed by western blotting . Thickening of the mice dorsal and ear skin was measured and inflammatory cell infiltration was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining . Results showed that EAA means ethanol extract suppressed IL-8 , IL-6 , TARC , and RANTES production . EAA means ethanol extract inhibited nuclear translocation of NFκB and STAT-1 means signal transducer, and activator of transcription-1 , as well as reduced the levels of phosphorylated ERK MAPKs . EAA means ethanol extract improved AD-like skin lesions in DNCB-treated mice . These findings suggest that EAA means ethanol extract possesses stronger anti-inflammatory properties and can be useful as a functional food or candidate agent for AD .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a repetitive inflammatory skin disorder with limited treatment options . Innovative targeted therapies are gaining significant interest and momentum towards disease control including better ways to deliver drugs topically . Tacrolimus is one such compound which is used to manage moderate to severe AD means Atopic dermatitis without causing atrophy which is one of the common side effects of steroids . However , Tacrolimus suffers from poor solubility and retention in the skin when used alone in hydrogel . Therefore , we have prepared Tacrolimus loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( TMSNs means Tacrolimus loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles ) to overcome the issues related to its solubility and effective topical delivery . Mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs means Mesoporous silica nanoparticles ) were synthesized using sol gel technique and surface functionalized using amino ( -NH < sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup > ) and phosphonate ( -PO < sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup > ) groups . Tacrolimus was loaded into MSNs means Mesoporous silica nanoparticles and the particles were characterized for particle size ( TEM and DLS means Tacrolimus was loaded into MSNs and the particles were characterized for particle size and DLS means DLS), zeta potential ) , zeta potential ( DLS means DLS), zeta potential ) , solubility studies , FTIR , TGA , XRD , BET and cytotoxicity studies . Water solubility of Tacrolimus was increased by 7 folds with phosphonate functionalized MSNs means Mesoporous silica nanoparticles compared to free Tacrolimus . Further the TMSNs means Tacrolimus loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were incorporated in to carbopol gel , and the gel formulation was evaluated for various gel characterization tests ( pH , spreadability , viscosity ) , in vitro tests ( drug release , permeability studies ) and in vivo tests ( skin irritation study and efficacy studies ) using 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene ( DNFB ) induced dermatitis in Balb/c mice . Results of in vitro and in vivo study showed that TMSNs means Tacrolimus loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded gel showed significantly higher amount of Tacrolimus retained ( ex vivo - rat skin ) and much higher reduction in ear thickness and improved histology ( in vivo - in mice ) . Our data collectively suggest that MSNs means Mesoporous silica nanoparticles incorporated hydrogel as a promising new formulation strategy for topical delivery of poorly soluble drugs .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common skin disorder difficult to be treated with medication . This study investigated the potential of ovalicin extracted from < i > Cordyceps militaris</i > for the treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis using < i > in vitro</i > and < i > in vivo</i > models . We found that , in canine macrophage cell line DH82 , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS means lipopolysaccharide ) upregulated the expression of genes associated with inflammation and pruritic responses through activating calcium and interleukin-31 ( IL-31 ) signaling , and the upregulation could be suppressed by ovalicin , with an effect significantly stronger than dexamethasone . Ovalicin also reduced the expression of IL-31 downstream genes , including < i > JAK2</i > ( Janus kinase 2 ) , < i > TRPV1</i > ( transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 ) , and < i > HRH2</i > ( histamine receptor H2 ) . Ovalicin significantly alleviated the allergic symptoms in the AD means Atopic dermatitis mouse model . Histologically , the number of macrophages and mast cells infiltrated in the dermis was significantly reduced by ovalicin treatment . In the skin tissue of AD means Atopic dermatitis mice , reduction of IL-31 receptor was observed in the ovalicin treated group compared to the group without ovalicin treatment . To our knowledge , this is the first study to elucidate the anti-atopic mechanism of ovalicin , which could be an alternative to steroidal drugs commonly used for AD means Atopic dermatitis treatment .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by eczematous skin lesions and intense pruritus . It is often associated with other atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis , bronchial asthma and eosinophilic oesophagitis . Dupilumab is the first biologic approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in Switzerland . Dupilumab targets the interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 receptor and thus inhibits the signalling of IL-4 and IL-13 , two key mediators of type 2 inflammation , resulting in an improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis . Patients with atopic dermatitis present more often with ocular surface diseases ( OSDs means ocular surface diseases ) , such as allergic conjunctivitis , blepharitis and keratitis as well as infectious conjunctivitis and keratoconus compared with the general population . Upon dupilumab therapy , increased rates of ocular surface diseases have been reported in clinical trials . Interestingly , dupilumab-associated ( da means dupilumab-associated ) OSD is restricted to atopic dermatitis patients and has not been observed in asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis trials . Fortunately , most cases of dupilumab-associated OSD are mild-to-moderate and transient . Thus , ocular surface disease presents a particular adverse event of treatment with dupilumab in dermatology . This article aims at providing a practical guide for physicians , with a special focus on dermatologists , allergists and ophthalmologists in Switzerland , to the diagnosis and management of dupilumab-associated OSD in atopic dermatitis patients . For this purpose , an expert group of dermatologists and ophthalmologists from university and cantonal hospitals in Switzerland reviewed data on ocular surface diseases published in clinical trial and real-life reports of dupilumab therapy , published case reports and case series on the management of dupilumab-associated OSD , as well as recent recommendations provided by experts of national and international boards . Based on the observations of dupilumab-associated OSD and practical experiences in identifying and treating OSD , an algorithm has been developed that is specific to the needs in Switzerland . Considering concomitant ocular diseases and differential diagnoses , the clinical presentation of dupilumab-associated OSD and its response to therapeutic measures , a stepwise approach is recommended . Mild dupilumab-associated OSD can be managed by dermatologists and allergists , whereas patients with moderate-to-severe OSD requiring corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor therapy should necessarily be referred to an ophthalmologist . The effects of preventive measures , such as artificial tears , are uncertain . The recommendations provided here should guarantee a prompt and effective treatment of OSD for patients under dupilumab therapy in order to prevent that an otherwise potent therapy has to be ceased because of ocular adverse events .\n",
        "Objective To quantitatively evaluate the associations of PM < sub>2.5</sub>,PM < sub>10</sub>,NO < sub>2</sub>,and SO < sub>2</sub > concentrations with the outpatient visits for atopic dermatitis in Lanzhou . Methods The data of outpatient visits , together with meteorological data and air pollutant data , from January 2013 to December 2017 were collected . The generalized additive model based on Poisson distribution was employed to study the lag effects of PM < sub>2.5</sub>,PM < sub>10</sub>,NO < sub>2</sub>,and SO < sub>2</sub > concentrations on the visits of outpatients , with the seasonal and long-term trends and day-of-the-week effect controlled . Results The results of the single pollutant model showed that PM < sub>2.5</sub > and PM < sub>10</sub > had the most obvious while still insignificant impact on the outpatient visits for atopic dermatitis on the current day(lag0).NO < sub>2</sub > also had the most obvious impact in the case of lag0 and showed a lag effect . For each 10 μg/m < sup>3</sup > increase in NO < sub>2</sub > concentration , the excess risk(ER)of outpatient visits for atopic dermatitis was 1.95%(95 % < i > CI</i>=1.09%-2.82%,<i > P</i>=0.01).SO < sub>2</sub > had the most significant effect on lag6,and the outpatient visits increased by 1.55%(95 % < i > CI</i>=0.48%-2.54%)for every 10 μg/m < sup>3</sup > rise in SO < sub>2</sub > concentration(<i > P</i>=0.02).Females were more sensitive to PM < sub>10</sub > and SO < sub>2</sub > than males . For every 10 μg/m < sup>3</sup > increase in PM < sub>10</sub > and SO < sub>2</sub>,the female outpatient visits increased by 0.02 % and 2.47%,respectively . Males were sensitive to PM < sub>2.5</sub > and NO < sub>2</sub>,and the every 10 μg/m < sup>3</sup > rise in PM < sub>2.5</sub > and NO < sub>2</sub > increased male outpatient visits by 0.47 % and 1.78%,respectively . Gaseous pollutants(NO < sub>2</sub > and SO < sub>2</sub>)had more significant effect on people ≤2 years old than on those of other ages . Every 10 μg/m < sup>3</sup > rise in NO < sub>2</sub > and SO < sub>2</sub > would increase the ≤2-year-old outpatient visits by 2.35 % and 1.57%,respectively(<i > P</i>=0.02).People of 13 - 59 years old were sensitive to NO < sub>2</sub > concentration , and every 10 μg/m < sup>3</sup > rise in NO < sub>2</sub > concentration increased their visits by 1.39%.NO < sub>2</sub > affected the outpatient visits during the cold and warm seasons , with the ER values of 2.35 % and 1.89%,respectively(<i > P</i>=0.01).Particulate matter(PM < sub>2.5</sub > and PM < sub>10</sub>)had the most obvious yet insignificant association with the outpatient visits in winter . The interactions between PM < sub>2.5</sub > and NO < sub>2</sub>,between PM < sub>10</sub > and NO < sub>2</sub>,and between SO < sub>2</sub > and NO < sub>2</sub > affected the total outpatient visits for atopic dermatitis . The results of double pollutant model showed that in the presence of PM < sub>2.5</sub>,PM < sub>10</sub>,or SO < sub>2</sub>,the effect of NO < sub>2</sub > on the outpatient visits for atopic dermatitis enhanced compared with that predicted by single pollutant model(<i > P</i>=0.01 ) . Conclusion The air pollutants(PM < sub>2.5</sub>,PM < sub>10</sub>,NO < sub>2</sub>,and SO < sub>2</sub>)in Lanzhou were closely related to the outpatient visits for atopic dermatitis , and the increased concentrations of NO < sub>2</sub > and SO < sub>2</sub > was more likely to increase the risk of atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "JAK inhibitors are cytokine modulators that are effective in the treatment of numerous autoimmune diseases . However , given their immunosuppressive effects , they may , at least potentially , increase the risk of severe herpes infection in individuals with atopic dermatitis . To assess the utility of preventative antiviral treatment when initiating JAK inhibitors for atopic dermatitis in order to decrease risk of eczema herpeticum . JAK inhibitors , specifically tofacitinib and baricitinib , used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis confer an increased risk of herpes simplex virus infection . Acyclovir and valacyclovir are effective , safe , and affordable for herpes simplex virus prophylaxis . The risk of herpes simplex virus infection and eczema herpeticum associated with the use of various JAK inhibitors in atopic dermatitis treatment is not well characterized . The use of anti-herpes treatment when initiating a JAK inhibitor for atopic dermatitis may be prudent , as the costs and risks of prophylactic treatment are low and may be valuable for preventing eczema herpeticum .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin diseases in the world . It is characterized by recurrent eczematous legions and intense itch , and many cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis . Among them , much attention has been paid to interleukin 31 ( IL-31 ) as an AD-associated itch mediator . IL-31 is mainly produced by CD4 + helper T cells and transmits the signals via a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-31 receptor A ( IL-31RA means IL-31 receptor A ) and oncostatin M receptor ( OSMR means oncostatin M receptor ) , both of which are expressed in dorsal root ganglion ( DRG means dorsal root ganglion ) neurons . However , the molecular mechanisms of how IL-31 is produced in helper T cells upon stimulation and transmits the itch sensation to the brain were largely unknown . Recently , by using original mouse models of AD means Atopic dermatitis , we have identified endothelial PAS domain 1 ( EPAS1 means endothelial PAS domain 1 ) and neurokinin B ( NKB means neurokinin B ) as key molecules critical for IL-31 production and IL-31-mediated itch transmission , respectively . These molecules could be novel drug targets for AD-associated itch . This review highlights our recent findings , which show the functional significance of these molecules in the IL-31-induced itch sensation , referring to their application to drug development .\n",
        "Genetic and environmental factors influence stratum corneum ( SC means stratum corneum ) barrier properties and function . Researchers increasingly focus on biophysical studies that may help clinicians provide their patients with an informed choice on tailormade skincare . This literature review on skin barrier properties comparing different ethnic populations aims to offer insights into the information 's clinical relevance . A literature review followed by panel discussions and an online review process aimed to answer the questions : Are there racial/ethnic differences in the SC means stratum corneum barrier structure and healthy skin barrier function ? Is there a need for specific cleansers and moisturizers ? Ethnic categories based on race and ethnicity are often not well defined and inconsistent across different studies . Studies comparing ethnic groups ' physical and biochemical skin barrier properties have reported differences in transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) , skin lipid levels , pH , and mast cell granule size . However , these studies frequently had methodological flaws , mainly were small , and demonstrated conflicting results . The literature suggests racial/ethnic variations in ceramide content , SC means stratum corneum structure , and filaggrin mutations . Furthermore , studies have shown a greater burden of pruritus and atopic dermatitis among Black populations . Data on barrier properties in Hispanic/LatinX and South Asian populations are lacking . Robust comparative studies are needed to understand these basic concepts to help tailor skincare and skin of color patients ' education .

        "Atopic dermatitis has a substantial impact on work and activity impairment according to studies from Western communities . Prospective studies of work productivity and activity impairment in Asian patients with atopic dermatitis are lacking . The aims of this study were to investigate the impacts of atopic dermatitis on work productivity and activity impairment among Taiwanese patients , and to stratify the analyses by disease severity . One-third of employed participants reported missing work ( absenteeism ) in the preceding week due to atopic dermatitis , while 88.5 % of the remaining two-thirds reported impaired work effectiveness ( presenteeism ) . In addition , 92.5 % of all participants reported impaired daily activities . Overall work impairment ( aggregate productivity loss from absenteeism and presenteeism ) was 1.8- and 2.6-fold greater in subjects with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis , respectively , compared with those with mild atopic dermatitis . Presenteeism , but not absenteeism , contributes to the majority of total work impairment in this cohort . Daily activity impairment was 1.5-fold greater in moderate atopic dermatitis , and 2.0-fold greater in severe atopic dermatitis , compared with mild atopic dermatitis . Both work and activity impairment showed significant positive correlations with atopic dermatitis severity scores means SCORing Atopic Dermatitis; SCORAD ( SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ; SCORAD ) . In conclusion , work productivity and activity impairment is significantly correlated with disease severity in this Taiwanese atopic dermatitis cohort . In order to obtain a full picture of disease burden to patients and caregivers , patients with atopic dermatitis should be monitored for disease activity as well as corresponding impacts on quality of life .\n",
        "Extracellular vesicles ( EVs means Extracellular vesicles ) , and especially exosomes , have been shown to mediate information exchange between distant cells ; this process directly affects the biological characteristics and functionality of the recipient cell . As such , EVs means Extracellular vesicles significantly contribute to the shaping of immune responses in both physiology and disease states . While vesicles secreted by immune cells are often implicated in the allergic process , growing evidence indicates that EVs means Extracellular vesicles from non-immune cells , produced in the stroma or epithelia of the organs directly affected by inflammation may also play a significant role . In this review , we provide an overview of the mechanisms of allergy to which those EVs means Extracellular vesicles contribute , with a particular focus on small EVs means Extracellular vesicles ( sEVs means small EVs ) . Finally , we also give a clinical perspective regarding the utilization of the EV-mediated communication route for the benefit of allergic patients .\n",

Human cystatin A and the cat allergen Fel d 3 belong to the cystatin family , an evolutionary conserved protein family . The objective of the present study was to assess cross-reactivity between mammalian cystatins and to analyze T cell responses to cystatin in AD means atopic dermatitis patients sensitized to pet dander . cDNA coding for dog cystatin was cloned from dog skin . Sera of 245 patients with IgE-sensitization to cat and dog dander were tested for IgE-binding to recombinantly expressed feline , canine , and human cystatin , respectively . Of these , 141 were also diagnosed for AD means atopic dermatitis . Cystatin-specific IgE was detected in 14.7 % ( 36 ) of patients , of which 19 suffered from AD means atopic dermatitis . Within the AD means atopic dermatitis patients , 9 carried measurable IgE against all three cystatins . Cystatin-sensitized AD means atopic dermatitis patients did not differ from non-cystatin sensitized patients in terms of disease severity , age or total IgE levels . T cell cytokine measurements showed elevated IL-4 levels after stimulation with feline and human cystatin . The humoral response suggests that next to Fel d3 also the homologous protein from dog might play a role in allergy . Further on , the human cystatin appears to be capable of driving a type2 immune response in sensitized AD means atopic dermatitis patients and may therefore be considered a so-called autoallergen , as it has been proposed for other evolutionary conserved proteins .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease mainly caused by immune stimuli . The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of ROCEN and to compare it with betamethasone ( Beta means betamethasone ) on mice subjected to AD means Atopic dermatitis . First , the safety of topical ROCEN was tested to determine possible sensitization induction in vivo . Then , the mice were subjected to oxazolone ( Oxa means oxazolone ) to induce chronic AD means Atopic dermatitis . Consequently , they underwent treatment with ROCEN and Beta means betamethasone . Scratching and wiping behaviors related to dermatitis were evaluated in treated animals for 35 days . The histopathology and immunohistochemistry ( IHC means immunohistochemistry ) analysis of interleukin-8 ( IL-8 means interleukin-8 ) and tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α means tumor necrosis factor-α ) cytokines were performed on the dorsal skin of the treated mice . Topical administration of ROCEN and Beta means betamethasone to the dorsum of sensitized mice for 5 weeks significantly alleviated scratching and wiping symptoms and reduced erythema , scaling , and edema in the skin of the mice with AD means Atopic dermatitis . Moreover , histological indices showed that ROCEN effectively reduced leucocyte infiltration and improved skin healing parameters in treated AD means Atopic dermatitis mice . Application of ROCEN or Beta means betamethasone reduced IHC means immunohistochemistry markers including IL-8 means interleukin-8 and TNF-α means tumor necrosis factor-α significantly . ROCEN alleviated the AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms similar to betamethasone in an experimental animal model .\n",
        "Allergic skin diseases are highly prevalent among children . Patients with allergic skin diseases experience sociopsychological and quality-of-life ( QoL means quality-of-life ) burdens in excess of those in the general population . Children and their caregivers are especially vulnerable to the burden of many of the common allergic skin diseases . In the past few decades , researchers have developed a number of disease-specific scores and indices for the measurement of QoL means quality-of-life for childhood skin diseases . Most of the research in this area has focused on atopic eczema and urticaria and less so on allergic contact dermatitis . We provide an overview of QoL means quality-of-life and its assessment for these dermatologic conditions .\n",
        "Topical Janus kinase ( JAK means Janus kinase ) and phosphodiesterase-4 ( PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 ) inhibitors are novel treatment approaches for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors for AD means atopic dermatitis treatment . The databases of PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Library were searched until June 2021 for eligible studies of AD means atopic dermatitis patients treated with topical JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors . Baseline and follow-up data were extracted . Efficacy of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors was evaluated using Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment ) achieving \" clear \" or \" almost clear \" , with 2 points or more improvement from baseline at the end of treatment , referred to as \" IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response \" ) . A Bayesian multiple treatment network meta-analysis with fixed effects was performed . Odds ratio ( OR means Odds ratio ) with 95 % credibility interval ( CrI means credibility interval ) were used for comparing the efficacy of JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors with placebo for AD means atopic dermatitis . A total of 10 randomized controlled trials of topical JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors with 4689 patients were included for analysis . A total of three topical JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors and two topical PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors were included . Compared with placebo , all JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors had higher IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response at 4 weeks of treatment . Notably , with similar safety profile , tofacitinib 2 % b.i.d . , ruxolitinib 1.5 % b.i.d . , and delgocitinib 3 % b.i.d . showed favorable IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response compared with topical tacrolimus and corticosteroids . Ranking analysis suggested that among all included JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors , tofacitinib 2 % b.i.d . had the highest probability of achieving IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response ( SUCRA = 0.880 ) . Besides , JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors showed non-inferior safety profile with placebo . This study confirmed that topical JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors had promising treatment efficacy and safety for AD means atopic dermatitis patients . Tofacitinib 2 % b.i.d . , ruxolitinib 1.5 % b.i.d . and delgocitinib 3 % b.i.d . showed superior efficacy over other JAK means Janus kinase and PDE4 means phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors .\n",
        "Epicutaneous exposure to allergenic proteins is an important sensitization route for skin diseases like protein contact dermatitis , immunologic contact urticaria , and atopic dermatitis . Environmental allergen sources such as house dust mites contain proteases , which are frequent allergens themselves . Here , the dependency of T-helper ( T < sub > H</sub > ) cell recall responses on allergen protease activity in the elicitation phase in mice pre-sensitized via distant skin was investigated . Repeated epicutaneous administration of a model protease allergen , i.e. papain , to the back skin of hairless mice induced skin inflammation , serum papain-specific IgE and T < sub > H</sub>2 and T < sub > H</sub>17 cytokine responses in the sensitization sites , and antigen-restimulated draining lymph node cells . In the papain-sensitized but not vehicle-treated mice , subsequent single challenge on the ear skin with papain , but not with protease inhibitor-treated papain , up-regulated the gene expression of T < sub > H</sub>2 and T < sub > H</sub>17/T < sub > H</sub>22 cytokines along with cytokines promoting these T < sub > H</sub > cytokine responses ( TSLP , IL-33 , IL-17C , and IL-23p19 ) . Up-regulation of IL-17A gene expression and cells expressing RORγt occurred in the ear skin of the presensitized mice even before the challenge . In a reconstructed epidermal model with a three-dimensional culture of human keratinocytes , papain but not protease inhibitor-treated papain exhibited increasing transdermal permeability and stimulating the gene expression of TSLP , IL-17C , and IL-23p19 . This study demonstrated that allergen protease activity contributed to the onset of cutaneous T < sub > H</sub>2 and T < sub > H</sub>17/T < sub > H</sub>22 recall responses on allergen re-encounter at sites distant from the original epicutaneous sensitization exposures . This finding suggested the contribution of protease-dependent barrier disruption and induction of keratinocyte-derived cytokines to the recall responses .\n",
        "We aimed to investigate the effects of dupilumab on 1 ) the permeability and antimicrobial barrier , 2 ) the composition of the skin microbiome , and 3 ) the correlation between changes in skin barrier properties and microbiota in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) patients . Ten patients with severe AD means atopic dermatitis were treated with dupilumab for 12 weeks . Disease severity was assessed using the Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) . Skin barrier function was evaluated by measuring transepidermal water loss , stratum corneum ( SC means stratum corneum ) hydration , and pH. The following parameters were analyzed in the pre- and post-treatment SC means stratum corneum samples ; 1 ) skin microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing , 2 ) lipid composition using mass spectrometry , and 3 ) human β-defensin 2 ( hBD-2 ) expression using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . SC means stratum corneum hydration levels in the lesional and non-lesional skin increased after 12-week dupilumab therapy ( 24.2 % , < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 and 59.9 % , < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 , respectively , vs. baseline ) and correlated with EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index improvement ( < i > r</i > = 0.90 , < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 and < i > r</i > = 0.85 , < i > P</i > = 0.003 , respectively ) . Dupilumab increased the long-chain ceramide levels in atopic skin ( 118.4 % , < i > P</i > = 0.028 vs. baseline ) that correlated with changes in SC means stratum corneum hydration ( < i > r</i > = 0.81 , < i > P</i > = 0.007 ) and reduced the elevated hBD-2 messenger RNA levels ( -15.4 % , < i > P</i > = 0.005 vs. baseline ) in the lesional skin . Dupilumab decreased the abundance < i > of Staphylococcus aureus.</i > In contrast , the microbial diversity and the abundance of < i > Cutibacterium</i > and < i > Corynebacterium species</i > increased , which were correlated with an increase in SC means stratum corneum hydration levels ( Shannon diversity , < i > r</i > = 0.71 , < i > P</i > = 0.027 ; < i > Cutibacterium</i > , < i > r</i > = 0.73 , < i > P</i > = 0.017 ; < i > Corynebacterium</i > , < i > r</i > = 0.75 , < i > P</i > = 0.012 ) . Increased abundance of < i > Cutibacterium species</i > was also correlated with EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index improvement ( < i > r</i > = 0.68 , < i > P</i > = 0.032 ) . Th2 blockade-induced normalization of skin microbiome in AD means atopic dermatitis patients is associated with increased SC means stratum corneum hydration .\n",
        "Eosinophils are frequently found in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria ) that release eosinophil peroxidase ( EPX means eosinophil peroxidase ) and eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP means eosinophil cationic protein ) . Continuous exposure to these proteins could trigger an autoimmune response which may contribute to the pathogenesis and severity of skin inflammation . In this study , we investigate the immunoglobulin E ( IgE means immunoglobulin E ) response against eosinophil proteins in CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria and AD means atopic dermatitis . We recruited patients with severe AD means atopic dermatitis , severe CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria and healthy subjects to explore the presence of IgE means immunoglobulin E autoantibodies and cross-reactivity against EPX means eosinophil peroxidase , ECP means eosinophil cationic protein and thyroid peroxidase ( TPO means thyroid peroxidase ) . The potential cross-reactive epitopes among the peroxidase family were determined using < i > in silico</i > tools . The frequencies of anti-EPX IgE means immunoglobulin E ( 28.8 % ) and anti-ECP IgE means immunoglobulin E ( 26.6 % ) were higher in the AD means atopic dermatitis group , and anti-TPO IgE means immunoglobulin E was higher in the CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria group ( 27.2 % ) . In the CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria group , there was a correlation between the anti-EPX IgE means immunoglobulin E and anti-TPO IgE means immunoglobulin E levels ( < i > r</i > = 0.542 , < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) ; TPO means thyroid peroxidase inhibited 42 % of IgE means immunoglobulin E binding to EPX means eosinophil peroxidase , while EPX means eosinophil peroxidase inhibited 59 % of IgE means immunoglobulin E binding to TPO means thyroid peroxidase , suggesting a cross-reactivity with EPX means eosinophil peroxidase as a primary sensitizer . There was greater inhibition when we used a pool of sera CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria and AD means atopic dermatitis , TPO means thyroid peroxidase inhibited 52 % of IgE means immunoglobulin E binding to EPX means eosinophil peroxidase , while EPX means eosinophil peroxidase inhibited 78 % of IgE means immunoglobulin E binding to TPO means thyroid peroxidase . < i > In silico</i > analysis showed a possible shared epitope in the peroxidase protein family . IgE means immunoglobulin E against eosinophil proteins may contribute to chronic inflammation in patients with AD means atopic dermatitis and CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria . Cross-reactivity between EPX means eosinophil peroxidase and TPO means thyroid peroxidase could explain thyroid problems in CSU means chronic spontaneous urticaria patients .\n",
        "Dupilumab is recommended to be administered biweekly to treat adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Real clinical practice data on the clinical efficacy of monthly dupilumab therapy are limited . We analyzed real clinical practice data on the clinical efficacy of monthly dupilumab therapy and predictive markers for favorable clinical responses to the therapy . Medical records of 57 adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis who received dupilumab therapy every 4 weeks for 16 weeks were analyzed retrospectively . Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) were recorded at baseline and week 16 . Clinical responses to monthly dupilumab therapy were defined as the proportion of patients with decreased EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index scores of at least 50 % or 75 % from baseline at week 16 ( EASI-50 or EASI-75 ) . Blood eosinophil counts and serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH means lactate dehydrogenase ) levels were measured at baseline and week 16 . Monthly dupilumab therapy showed EASI-50 and EASI-75 clinical responses in 48 ( 84.2 % ) and 27 ( 47.4 % ) of 57 patients at week 16 , respectively . The percentage decrease in EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index scores from baseline at week 16 was significantly inversely correlated with baseline blood eosinophil count ( correlation coefficient [ < i > r</i > ] = -0.405 , < i > P</i > = 0.002 ) and baseline serum LDH means lactate dehydrogenase level ( < i > r</i > = -0.466 , < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) . The EASI-75 response rate was higher in patients with low ( & lt ; 500/µL , 73.3 % ) than in those with high ( ≥ 500/µL , 37.5 % ) baseline blood eosinophil counts ( < i > P</i > = 0.032 ) , and was higher in patients with low ( & lt ; 400 U/L , 55.6 % ) than those with high ( ≥ 400 U/L , 10.0 % ) baseline serum LDH means lactate dehydrogenase levels ( < i > P</i > = 0.013 ) . Monthly dupilumab therapy was clinically effective in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis in real clinical practice . Baseline blood eosinophil count and serum LDH means lactate dehydrogenase level could be predictive markers for clinical response to dupilumab therapy .\n",
        "Allergic diseases ( atopic dermatitis , food allergy , eosinophilic esophagitis , asthma and allergic rhinitis ) , perhaps more than many other traditionally grouped disorders , share several overlapping inflammatory pathways and risk factors , though we are still beginning to understand how the relevant patient and environmental factors uniquely shape each disease . Precision medicine is the concept of applying multiple levels of patient-specific data to tailor diagnoses and available treatments to the individual ; ideally , a patient receives the right intervention at the right time , in order to maximize effectiveness but minimize morbidity , mortality and cost . While precision medicine in allergy is in its infancy , the recent success of biologics , development of tools focused on large data set integration and improved sampling methods are encouraging and demonstrates the utility of refining our understanding of allergic endotypes to improve therapies . Some of the biggest challenges to achieving precision medicine in allergy are characterizing allergic endotypes , understanding allergic multimorbidity relationships , contextualizing the impact of environmental exposures ( the \" exposome \" ) and ancestry/genetic risks , achieving actionable multi-omics integration , and using this information to develop adequately powered patient cohorts and refined clinical trials . In this paper , we highlight several recently developed tools and methods showing promise to realize the aspirational potential of precision medicine in allergic disease . We also outline current challenges , including exposome sampling and building the \" knowledge network \" with multi-omics integration .\n",
        "Eosinophilic asthma ( EA means Eosinophilic asthma ) is a common subtype of asthma and often progresses to severe disease . In order to understand its pathogenesis , targeted next-generation gene sequencing was performed on 77 Chinese EA means Eosinophilic asthma patients and 431 Chinese healthy controls to obtain differential genomic variations . Among the 41 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs means Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ) screened for mutation sites in more than 3 patients , filaggrin gene < i > FLG</i > rs192116923 T&gt;G and < i > FLG</i > rs75235053 C&gt;G were newly found to be associated with EA means Eosinophilic asthma patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) ( P & lt;0.001 ) and severe EA means Eosinophilic asthma ( P=0.032 ) , respectively . Filaggrin has been shown to be mainly expressed in epithelial cells and plays an important role in formation of an effective skin barrier . Bioinformatic analysis indicated < i > FLG</i > rs192116923 T&gt;G may increase the binding of Smad3 to transmit TGF-β1 signaling , and thereby inhibit filaggrin expression , and < i > FLG</i > rs75235053 C&gt;G may add new splicing sites to reduce filaggrin monomers . It has been known that the level of Th2 cytokine IL-4 is increased in EA means Eosinophilic asthma patients , and IL-4 increases airway epithelial permeability and enhances inflammatory response through some unclear mechanisms . To figure out whether filaggrin is involved in immune responses in asthma , we have treated human respiratory epithelial cell line BEAS-2B cells with IL-4 and found that the expression levels of filaggrin and E-cadherin decreased significantly in a time and dose-dependent manner , suggesting that IL-4 increased airway epithelial permeability by reducing filaggrin and adhesion molecule . In addition , in our study , IL-4 increased the expression of epithel-derived inflammatory cytokines IL-33 and TSLP which further enhanced the Th2 inflammatory response . To investigate the role of filaggrin in development of EA means Eosinophilic asthma , knockdown filaggrin with siRNA revealed a decrease in E-cadherin levels , which were further down-regulated by IL-4 stimulation . Knockdown of filaggrin alone did not affect the levels of IL-33 and TSLP , but further exacerbated the decrease of IL-33/TSLP caused by IL-4 , suggesting that filaggrin may involve in IL-4R signaling pathway to regulate the level of IL-33/TSLP . In conclusion , in the Th2 cytokine milieu of asthma , < i > FLG</i > deficient mutation in airway epithelial cells may increase the epithelial permeability and the expression of IL-33/TSLP which positively feedback the Th2 inflammation response .\n",

        "Pruritus is a common symptom of dermatological disorders and has a major negative impact on QOL . Previously , it was suggested that human β-defensin peptides elicit itch through the activation of mast cells . In this study , we investigated in more detail the mechanisms by which β-defensins induce itch by defining the receptors activated by these peptides in humans and mice , by establishing their action in vivo , and by examining their expression in inflammatory dermal diseases . We found that elevated expression of DEFB103 is highly correlated with skin lesions in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . We showed that the peptide encoded by this gene and related genes activate Mas-related G protein-coupled receptors with different potencies that are related to their charge density . Furthermore , we establish that although these peptides can activate mast cells , they also activate sensory neurons , with the former cells being dispensable for itch reactions in mice . Together , our studies highlight that specific β-defensins are likely endogenous pruritogens that can directly stimulate sensory neurons .\n",

The relationships between recruitment method and patient age , sex , race , study completion and costs were analysed . The majority of patients recruited were young , with millennials and Gen Z comprising 77 % of the study population . Both traditional and modern recruitment methods were equally successful in recruiting younger patients , with older patients predominately recruited by traditional methods . Eighty per cent more men were recruited by traditional compared to modern methods , whilst 67 % more women than men were recruited by modern methods . Recruitment method neither appeared to be influenced by race , nor did it effect whether patients completed the study . Costs per enrolment were similar for both methods . This study shows that despite the high proportion of young patients and the rising popularity of social media and increased internet use , a combination of both traditional and modern recruitment methods was required to successfully meet the trial enrolment target of 100 adult patients with moderate eczema .\n",

Smoking during pregnancy was recorded in 164 ( 25.3 % ) mothers . During the first year of life , asthma was diagnosed in 101 infants , with an incidence of 15.7 % . The diagnoses of asthma ( 25.6 % vs. 12.3 % ; P & lt ; 0.0001 ) and bronchiolitis ( 44.5 % vs. 28.6 % ; P = 0.0002 ) during the first year of life were more common among infants in the smoking group . The probability of developing asthma during the first year of life was two-fold higher for the male gender and 2.5 times higher when mothers smoked while pregnant . Up to 52 % of asthma cases could have been avoided in infants born to smoking mothers if they did not smoke during pregnancy . Infants in the smoking group showed a lower weight and length at birth than infants in the nonsmoking group differences almost disappeared at 6 months and 12 months . Asthma during the first year of life showed a clear relationship with maternal smoking in pregnancy . Pregnant women should be advised of the significant perinatal risk for respiratory diseases associated with tobacco use .\n",
        "Allergic diseases could play a role of a predisposing factor for coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 ) . The aim of this study was to investigate allergic comorbidity and its association in COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 patients . Demographic data , clinical manifestations , laboratory reports , and radiologic findings , together with underlying comorbidity of patients , were studies . Allergic diseases were identified by using the standard GA < sup>2</sup > LEN questionnaire . The severity of COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 was assessed by a visual analog scale ( VAS means visual analog scale ) and an intensive care unit ( ICU means intensive care unit ) report . Out of 400 COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted in the hospital , 158 ( 39.5 % ) presented with different allergic diseases , and a reverse association was observed between having allergic comorbidity and severity of COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 infection ( P = 0.005 , relative risk = 0.96 ; 95 % Confidence Interval ( 95 % CI ): 0.77 - 1.19 ) . The respective frequency of asthma , allergic rhinitis means rhinosinusitis (CRS ( AR means allergic rhinitis ) , chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS means chronic rhinosinusitis ) , atopic dermatitis , chronic urticaria , and food or drug allergy was 7.3 % , 16 % , 1.8 % , 5 % , 10 % and 13.3 % . Significantly , only AR means allergic rhinitis was reversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 ( P = 0.02 , relative risk = 0.45 ; 95 % CI : 0.77 - 1.19 ) . Additionally , 43 % of the patients presented hypoxemia , and 93.5 % had chest CT scan involvement . Interestingly , patients with allergic diseases had significantly lower hypoxemia and chest CT involvement as compared with non-allergic patients ( P = 0.002 and 0.003 , respectively ) . The results of this study established that allergic diseases were not determined to be a predisposing factor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS means severe acute respiratory syndrome ) due to coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection . Significantly , AR means allergic rhinitis patients developed mild clinical manifestations of COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 and admitted to ICU means intensive care unit as compared to non-AR patients .\n",
        "Allergic diseases are one of the most common and important diseases that can exert hazardous effects on children 's health . The prevalence of allergic diseases in childhood is gradually increasing all over the world in recent decades . Known causes of these diseases include anomalous immune responses and allergic inflammatory reactions , but the causes of allergic diseases in childhood are complex . PubMed , Cochrane Library , Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles focusing on environmental exposure during pregnancy and the risk of childhood allergic diseases , including asthma and atopic dermatitis , and the possible underlying mechanism . In terms of environmental factors , allergic diseases in childhood are closely related to environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy , including bisphenols , phthalates acid esters , perfluorochemicals , polybrominated diphenyl ethers , and polychlorinated biphenyls . However , allergic diseases in childhood are also closely associated with maternal dietary nutrition , maternal intake of drugs , such as acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) , paracetamol and antibiotics , and maternal lifestyle . Several harmful environmental factors during pregnancy can result in the interruption of the function of helper T cells ( Th1/Th2 ) , cytokines and immunoglobulins and may activate allergic reactions , which can lead to allergic diseases during childhood .\n",
        "There are limited clinical data on the impact of the SARS-CoV2 infection on patients with dermatological conditions treated with biologics . Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG < sub>4</sub > human monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL4 and IL13 signaling , and is used for moderate-severe atopic dermatitis treatment . We present three patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) treated with dupilumab who contracted COVID-19 . In all patients , the infection had a mild course , and only in one , as documented by SCORAD , EASI , and DLQI scores , the condition of the skin deteriorated , and a prolonged positive PCR COVID-19 test was observed . The mechanism of dupilumab action and more evidence for IL13 importance in lung damage caused by SARS-CoV2 suggest a possible explanation for a mild-moderate course of the infection in treated AD means atopic dermatitis patients . Based on current knowledge , there is evidence to continue dupilumab treatment in AD means atopic dermatitis patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 ; however , careful assessment is needed for each patient .\n",
        "During the COVID-19 pandemic , teledermatology service was increased rapidly . The purpose of our study was to analyze the characteristics of patients and common skin diseases via teledermatology during the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China . During weekends between January 21 and April 4 , 2020 , the data of patients who used teledermatology service via a mobile application were collected , including gender , age , and diagnosis . A total of 698 patients ( 315 men and 383 women ) , with a mean age of 26 years , used this service . The top ten common diseases in order of proportion were eczema ( 22 % ) , acne ( 9 % ) , atopic dermatitis ( 9 % ) , urticaria ( 5 % ) , contact dermatitis ( 5 % ) , herpes zoster ( 3 % ) , warts ( 3 % ) , folliculitis ( 3 % ) , prurigo ( 3 % ) , and androgenetic alopecia ( 2 % ) . When classified according to age groups , atopic dermatitis was the most common condition for patients in the first decade , acne was more prevalent in the second and third decades , and eczema was the most prevalent condition for all other age groups . The ten common diseases accounted for the majority of the evaluated cases and varied by age group , allowing individualizing teledermatology services .\n",
        "< b > Background:</b > Crisaborole is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) ; however , the efficacy and safety of crisaborole in patients with AD means atopic dermatitis and other atopic comorbidities have not been investigated . < b > Objective:</b > This < i > post hoc</i > pooled analysis of the pivotal phase III studies ( CrisADe CORE 1 and CORE 2 ) assessed the efficacy and safety of crisaborole versus vehicle in patients aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD means atopic dermatitis and other atopic comorbidities . < b > Methods:</b > Patients with mild-to-moderate AD means atopic dermatitis and a medical history of asthma , allergic rhinitis , or food allergies were identified . Efficacy assessments included the proportion of patients who achieved Investigator 's Static Global Assessment ( ISGA means Investigator's Static Global Assessment ) success at day 29 , ISGA means Investigator's Static Global Assessment clear or almost clear at day 29 , and improvement in the Severity of Pruritus Scale score at week 4 .

        "Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin ( IL means interleukin ) 4 and IL13 pathways . We performed a retrospective observational study to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab for the treatment of adult patients referred to our department , from January 2019 to May 2021 , with a diagnosis of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and concomitant chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ( CRSwNP means chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ) , with a clinical indication for dupilumab treatment . Skin disease activity was assessed using EASI , Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS means Numerical Rating Scale ) for pruritus ( P-NRS ) and sleep ( S-NRS ) , and Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index ) . The CRSwNP means chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps activity was evaluated using 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22 ) , endoscopic nasal polyp score ( ENPS means endoscopic nasal polyp score ) , nasal congestion or obstruction score ( scale 0 - 3 ) , loss-of-smell score ( scale 0 - 3 ) , and rhinosinusitis disease severity ( visual analog scale 0 - 10 cm ) . A significant improvement of all the score values was recorded assessing patients at baseline , week (W)16 , and W24 . In particular , concerning the CRSwNP means chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps , a reduction of ENPS means endoscopic nasal polyp score score ( baseline : 4.9 ± 1.85 ; W16 : 2.49 ± 1.42 , p & lt ; 0.01 ; W24 : 1.68 ± 1.25 , p & lt ; 0.01 ) and SNOT-22 ( baseline : 35.9 ± 19.11 ; W16 : 12.85 ± 6.31 , p & lt ; 0.01 ; W24 : 10.71 ± 7.29 , p & lt ; 0.01 ) was observed . Furthermore , dupilumab is a labeled drug for the treatment of both AD means atopic dermatitis and CRSwNP means chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps . The use of a single drug to obtain the improvement up to the near remission of AD means atopic dermatitis and CRSwNP means chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps increases not only patient 's compliance with the treatment , but also the benefits in terms of health cost related to these chronic diseases .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic , inflammatory cutaneous disorder characterized by a T helper 2 ( Th2 means T helper 2 ) immune response phenotype . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs means Extracellular vesicles ) are a heterogeneous family of cell-derived membranous structures , which transport cellular components such as DNA and proteins , and are involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes . Increasing evidence has shown that EVs means Extracellular vesicles secretion took part in the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis . However , the proteomic studies of plasma-derived EVs means Extracellular vesicles in AD means Atopic dermatitis patients have not been reported . In this study , we investigated the diversity of plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles collected from AD means Atopic dermatitis patients and healthy individuals and suggested that the candidates for uniquely or differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles could be a diagnostic marker in AD means Atopic dermatitis . The plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles were collected from 12 patients with moderate-to-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis and 13 healthy subjects . Proteomic analysis was performed by using a comprehensive nanoLC‑MS/MS method . Proteomic analysis revealed that a total of 1478 proteins in plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles were found to be common proteins in AD means Atopic dermatitis , whereas a total of 1597 proteins in plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles were found to be common proteins in HC . Eighty-six proteins in plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles showed more than 2.5-fold up-regulation , while a total of 225 proteins in plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles showed less than 1/2.5-fold down-regulation with a significant difference ( p & lt ; 0.05 ) among AD means Atopic dermatitis compared with HC . The candidates for differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs means Extracellular vesicles have been described as a connectivity PPI network related to several KEGG pathways , including pathways in platelet activation , complement , and so on . SLP-76 tyrosine phosphoprotein ( SLP76 means SLP-76 tyrosine phosphoprotein ) involved in platelet activation may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis . We will further verify the role of SLP67 in AD means Atopic dermatitis via animal and cell experiments to provide a promising therapeutic or diagnostic target .\n",
        "Research has highlighted associations between atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and mental health conditions in adults . However , literature on the development of mental health comorbidities in children is limited despite the large burden of pediatric AD means atopic dermatitis worldwide . To examine the association between AD means atopic dermatitis and internalizing behaviors and symptoms of depression at multiple points across childhood and adolescence and to explore potential mediating factors , including asthma/rhinitis , sleep , and inflammation . This longitudinal , population-based birth cohort study included children followed up from birth for a mean ( SD ) duration of 10.0 ( 2.9 ) years from the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children . Data were collected from September 6 , 1990 , to December 31 , 2009 . Data were analyzed from August 30 , 2019 , to July 30 , 2020 . Annual period prevalence of AD means atopic dermatitis assessed at 11 points from 6 months to 18 years of age , measured by standardized questions about flexural dermatitis . Symptoms of depression , measured using child-reported responses to the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire at 5 points from 10 to 18 years of age and internalizing behaviors , measured by maternal report of the Emotional Symptoms subscale of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire at 7 points from 4 to 16 years of age . Among the 11 181 children included in the analysis ( 5721 male [ 51.2 % ] ) , the period prevalence of symptoms of depression ranged from 6.0 % to 21.6 % ; for internalizing behaviors , from 10.4 % to 16.0 % . Although mild to moderate AD means atopic dermatitis was not associated with symptoms of depression , it was associated with internalizing behaviors as early as 4 years of age ( mean increased odds of 29%-84 % across childhood in adjusted models ) . Severe AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with symptoms of depression ( adjusted odds ratio , 2.38 ; 95 % CI , 1.21 - 4.72 ) and internalizing symptoms ( adjusted odds ratio , 1.90 ; 95 % CI , 1.14 - 3.16 ) . Sleep quality mediated some of this association , but it was not explained by differences in sleep duration , asthma/rhinitis , or levels of inflammatory markers ( interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein ) . Within this population-based birth cohort study in the UK , severe AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with symptoms of depression and internalizing behaviors throughout childhood and adolescence . Risk of internalizing symptoms was increased even for children with mild AD means atopic dermatitis beginning early in childhood , highlighting the importance of behavioral and mental health awareness in this population .\n",
        "We present seven cases of infectious keratitis after corneal crosslinking ( CXL ) to attenuate keratoconus progression . Of 524 consecutive patients who underwent CXL , 7 cases ( 4 males and 3 females ; 21.5 ± 7.1 years ) developed postoperative infectious keratitis were retrospectively reviewed . CXL was performed using the Dresden protocol or an accelerated protocol involving epithelial removal . All cases appeared normal on the day after surgery , but subsequently developed eye pain , blurred vision , corneal infiltration , inflammation of the anterior chamber , and ciliary injection on day 2 or 3 . Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from two eyes , methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus from two eyes , and Streptococcus pneumoniae from one eye . All detected bacteria were resistant to levofloxacin ( LVFX means levofloxacin ) . Five of the seven cases , especially four of the five severe cases with hypopyon , had a history of atopic dermatitis . All cases were observed after 2015 . Infectious keratitis after CXL caused by microbes resistant to LVFX means levofloxacin is increasing . In addition to careful postoperative observation of the cornea , preoperative evaluation of bacteria within the conjunctival sac evident on nasal swab cultures may be useful to identify potentially problematic microbes and inform the selection of appropriate antibiotics .\n",
        "Janus kinase ( JAK means Janus kinase ) inhibitors are emerging treatments for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Due to this novel role as a therapeutic option for patients with AD means atopic dermatitis , we aimed to review current evidence on the pathophysiology and the safety and adverse effects ( AEs means adverse effects ) of oral JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors for the treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis utilizing the key terms atopic dermatitis , JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors , and adverse effect or event . Our study indicated that oral JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors have a moderate safety profile for use in AD means atopic dermatitis in several reviews and phase II or III clinical trials . Headaches , nausea , and nasopharyngitis are the most commonly reported systemic AEs means adverse effects . Furthermore , acne , herpes simplex , herpes zoster , and eczema herpeticum are the most commonly recorded dermatological AEs means adverse effects . Current evidence indicates JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors may also have less association with some of the serious AEs means adverse effects , although there is potential for increased risk of asthma , acute pancreatitis , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia . Whereas data remain limited for the long-term safety of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitor use in patients with AD means atopic dermatitis , many ongoing clinical trials have promising preliminary results .\n",
        "Previous studies of dupilumab in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) showed no clinically meaningful adverse changes in laboratory parameters . The aim of this study was to assess laboratory outcomes in children aged 6 - 11 years with severe AD means atopic dermatitis in a randomized , placebo-controlled , phase III trial of dupilumab . Children aged 6 - 11 years with severe AD means atopic dermatitis were randomized 1:1:1 to 16 weeks of dupilumab 300 mg every 4 weeks , 100 or 200 mg every 2 weeks , or matching placebo , all with concomitant topical corticosteroids ( TCS means topical corticosteroids ) . Blood samples were collected at baseline and Weeks 4 , 8 , and 16 ; urine samples were collected at baseline and Weeks 4 and 16 . Of 367 patients enrolled in the study , 362 were included in the safety analysis , 351 completed study treatment , and 4 withdrew due to treatment-emergent adverse events not related to laboratory abnormalities . Both dupilumab + TCS means topical corticosteroids groups showed overall trends toward increases in mean blood levels of eosinophils and alkaline phosphatase , and decreases in mean blood levels of platelets , neutrophils , and lactate dehydrogenase levels , without corresponding mean changes in the placebo + TCS means topical corticosteroids group . None of these changes were associated with symptoms or clinically meaningful adverse outcomes , and none led to treatment modification . No clinically significant changes or trends were observed for other measured laboratory parameters . There were no clinically meaningful adverse changes in routine laboratory parameters attributable to treatment with dupilumab + TCS means topical corticosteroids . Changes in platelet counts and lactate dehydrogenase levels likely reflect reduced inflammation . These results confirm similar findings in adults and adolescents , and suggest that there is no need for routine laboratory monitoring of children aged 6 - 11 years treated with dupilumab + TCS means topical corticosteroids for severe AD means atopic dermatitis .

        "Evans syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder where patients develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia means AIHA), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP ( AIHA means autoimmune hemolytic anemia ) , immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP means immune thrombocytopenia ) , and less commonly immune neutropenia . Patients typically present with fatigue , pallor , jaundice , petechiae , or epistaxis . A 27-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis for which he recently began treatment with dupilumab presented to the emergency department with a headache and blurry vision . Multiple Roth spots were seen on fundoscopic examination . Laboratory studies were consistent with warm AIHA means autoimmune hemolytic anemia , confirmed by a positive direct antiglobulin test ( DAT means direct antiglobulin test ) , and severe thrombocytopenia . He was diagnosed with Evans syndrome . He was treated with corticosteroids , rituximab , and intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG means intravenous immunoglobulin ) . His recovery was prolonged with the slow improvement of anemia means AIHA), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP and thrombocytopenia . This is an atypical presentation of Evans syndrome with isolated symptoms of new-onset blurry vision and headache along with the finding of Roth spots . Another interesting feature in the case is the recent use of dupilumab . Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the T-helper cells type 2 ( Th2 means T-helper cells type 2 ) signaling pathway by blocking interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 binding . This alteration in the immune response could have a role in the development of Evans syndrome .\n",

        "Treatments for alopecia areata ( AA means areata ) patients with extensive scalp hair loss are limited , and recent evidence supports a role for type 2 T-cell (Th2)-immune response in AA means areata . Dupilumab , a monoclonal antibody inhibiting Th2 signaling , approved for type 2 diseases including atopic dermatitis , was evaluated in AA means areata patients . Alopecia areata patients with and without concomitant atopic dermatitis were randomized 2:1 to receive weekly subcutaneous dupilumab ( 300 mg ) or placebo for 24 weeks , followed by another 24-week dupilumab open-label phase . The primary outcome was change from baseline in the Severity of Alopecia Tool ( SALT means Severity of Alopecia Tool ) score at week 24 ; secondary outcomes included a range of measures of hair regrowth . Forty and 20 patients were assigned to the dupilumab and placebo arms , respectively . At week 24 , disease worsening was documented in the placebo arm , with a least-squares mean change in the SALT means Severity of Alopecia Tool score of -6.5 ( 95 % confidence-interval [ CI ] , -10.4 to -2.6 ) , versus a change of 2.2 ( 95 % CI , -0.6 to 4.94 ) in the dupilumab arm ( p & lt ; .05 ) .

In some of patients , PT means Patch test may assist in determining the cause of CSU means Chronic spontaneous urticaria .\n",
        "Pathogenic missense variants in the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing 1 ( KCTD1 ) gene are associated with autosomal dominant Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome ( SENS means Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome ) , a type of ectodermal dysplasia characterized by aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp , hairless posterior scalp nodules , absent or rudimentary nipples , breast aplasia and external ear anomalies . We report a child with clinical features of an ectodermal dysplasia , including sparse hair , dysmorphic facial features , absent nipples , 2 - 3 toe syndactyly , mild atopic dermatitis and small cupped ears with overfolded helices . We also review the published cases of SENS means Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome with molecularly confirmed KCTD1 variants . Using whole-exome sequencing , we identified a novel , de novo in-frame insertion in the broad-complex , tramtrack and bric-a-brac ( BTB means broad-complex, tramtrack and bric-a-brac ) domain of the KCTD1 gene . By comparing to the previously reported patients , we found that our patient 's clinical features and molecular variant are consistent with a diagnosis of SENS means Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome . This is only the 13th KCTD1 variant described and the first report of an in-frame insertion causing clinical features , expanding the mutational spectrum of KCTD1 and SENS means Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome .\n",

        "We present a 29-year-old non-atopic male apprentice power lineman and recreational cowboy with a case of allergic contact dermatitis due to both occupational and recreational exposure . He presented with a 4-month history of a pruritic , steroid-responsive , intermittent hand , foot and leg dermatitis . Patch testing was positive for chromium , cobalt and a piece of leather from his cowboy boots . His leather work gloves , inner lining of work harness , work boots and cowboy boots were assessed for chromium and cobalt content with handheld fluorescence x-ray spectrometry . Upon replacement of all leather items including the items tested and his leather cowboy saddle , the rash resolved . This case demonstrates the clinical relevance of using a handheld fluorescence x-ray spectrometer to assess for chromium and leather content .\n",
        "Current therapeutic options for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) are limited . Janus kinase ( JAK means Janus kinase ) inhibitors may be viable alternatives . To assess the efficacy and safety of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors for AD means atopic dermatitis treatment . We searched PubMed , Embase , the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials , Web of Science , Global Resource of Eczema Trials database , and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to September 1 , 2020 . Randomized clinical trials ( RCTs means Randomized clinical trials ) comparing JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors with placebo/vehicle treatment for AD means atopic dermatitis patients were included . The primary study outcomes included ( 1 ) the change ( % ) from the Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) baseline expressed as weighted mean difference ( WMD means weighted mean difference ) and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) , and ( 2 ) the Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment ) response and safety outcomes expressed as relative risk ( RR means relative risk ) and 95 % CI . We included 14 RCTs means Randomized clinical trials published in 13 studies ( 3,822 patients ) . Treatment with JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors significantly improved IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response ( RR means relative risk 2.83 , 95 % CI 2.25 - 3.56 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) and EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index score ( WMD means weighted mean difference -28.82 , 95 % CI -34.48 to -23.16 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) . JAK means Janus kinase inhibitor treatment achieved the largest improvement in both IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response ( RR means relative risk 3.59 , 95 % CI 2.66 - 4.84 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) and EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index score ( WMD means weighted mean difference -42.00 , 95 % CI -48.64 to -35.36 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) by week 4 of treatment . Topical JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors were significantly more efficacious than oral inhibitors . Upadacitinib treatment for 4 weeks was most effective in reducing EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index score ( WMD means weighted mean difference -53.92 , 95 % CI -69.26 to -38.58 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , while abrocitinib for 4 weeks led to the most effective IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response ( RR means relative risk 5.47 , 95 % CI 2.74 - 10.93 , p & lt ; 0.001 ) .

        "Rosa davurica Pall . , is mainly distributed in Korea , Japan , northeastern China , southeastern Siberia , and eastern Asia . It has been extensively used to treat various kinds of diseases by reason of the significant antioxidant , antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities . However , the pharmacological mechanism of Rosa davurica Pall . in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) is still ill defined and poorly understood . This study was to examine the anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism on AD means atopic dermatitis of Rosa davurica Pall . leaves ( RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves ) . To evaluate the therapeutic potential of RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves against AD means atopic dermatitis , we have investigated the effects of RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves on the inflammatory reactions and the productions of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that were induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/interferon-γ ( IFN-γ means (TNF-α)/interferon-γ ) in HaCaT cells . Futhermore , we examined the effects of RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves on the signaling pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK means mitogen-activated protein kinase ) and nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) . For the in-vivo studies , RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves extract was topically applied to the dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD means atopic dermatitis mice , then its therapeutic effect was evaluated physiologically and morphologically . After the stimulation of HaCaT cells with TNF-α/IFN-γ , RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves considerably reduced the release of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide ( NO means nitric oxide ) , PEG < sub>2</sub > and other cytokines . RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves also reduced the phosphorylations of MAPK means mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB in TNF-α/IFN-γ-stimulated HaCaT cells . In vivo topical application of RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves to DNCB-induced AD means atopic dermatitis mice significantly reduced the dorsal skin and ear thickness , clinical dermatitis severity , and mast cells . Treatment with RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves also markedly decreased the levels of serum IgE , IL-6 and the number of WBCs in the blood . Our studies indicate that RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves inhibits the AD-like skin lesions by modulating skin inflammation . Consequently , these results suggest that RDL means Rosa davurica Pall. leaves may be served as a possible alternative therapeutic treatment for skin disorder such as AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease with high heritability . Previous genome-wide association studies have identified several loci predisposing to AD means Atopic dermatitis . These findings explain approximately 30 % of the variance in AD means Atopic dermatitis susceptibility , suggesting that further work is required to fully understand the genetic underpinnings . We sought to gain additional understanding of the genetic contribution to AD means Atopic dermatitis risk by using biobank resources . We completed a genome-wide meta-analysis of AD means Atopic dermatitis in 796,661 individuals ( N < sub > cases</sub > = 22,474 ) from the FinnGen study , the Estonian Biobank , and the UK Biobank . We further performed downstream in silico analyses to characterize the risk variants at the novel loci . We report 30 loci associating with AD means Atopic dermatitis ( P & lt ; 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup > ) , 5 of which are novel . In 2 of the novel loci , we identified missense mutations with deleterious predictions in desmocollin 1 and serpin family B member 7 , genes encoding proteins crucial to epidermal strength and integrity . These findings elucidate novel genetic pathways involved in AD means Atopic dermatitis pathophysiology . The likely involvement of desmocollin 1 and serpin family B member 7 in AD means Atopic dermatitis pathogenesis may offer opportunities for the development of novel treatment strategies for AD means Atopic dermatitis in the future .\n",
        "Human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells ) therapy has recently been considered a promising treatment for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) due to their immunomodulation and tissue regeneration ability . In our previous studies , we demonstrated that hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells alleviate allergic inflammation in murine AD means atopic dermatitis model by inhibiting the activation of mast cells and B cells . Also our phase I/IIa clinical trial showed clinical efficacy and safety of hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells in moderate-to-severe adult AD means atopic dermatitis patients . However , hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells therapy against atopic dermatitis have had poor results in clinical field . Therefore , we investigated the reason behind this result . We hypothesized that drug-cell interaction could interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of stem cells , and investigated whether coadministration with pimecrolimus , one of the topical calcineurin inhibitors , could influence the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells ( hUCB-MSCs means human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells ) in AD means atopic dermatitis . hUCB-MSCs means human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells were subcutaneously injected to AD-induced mice with or without pimecrolimus topical application . To examine whether pimecrolimus influenced the immunomodulatory activity of hUCB-MSCs means human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells , hUCB-MSCs means human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells were treated with pimecrolimus . Pimecrolimus disturbed the therapeutic effect of hUCB-MSCs means human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells when they were co-administered in murine AD means atopic dermatitis model . Moreover , the inhibitory functions of hUCB-MSCs means human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells against type 2 helper T ( Th2 ) cell differentiation and mast cell activation were also deteriorated by pimecrolimus treatment . Interestingly , we found that pimecrolimus decreased the production of PGE < sub>2</sub > , one of the most critical immunomodulatory factors in hUCB-MSCs means human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells . And we demonstrated that pimecrolimus downregulated COX2-PGE < sub>2</sub > axis by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFAT3 . Coadministration of pimecrolimus with hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells could interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells in atopic dermatitis , and this is the first study that figured out the interaction of hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells with other drugs in cell therapy of atopic dermatitis . Therefore , this study might give rise to improvement of the clinical application of hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells therapy and facilitate the widespread application of hMSCs means Human mesenchymal stem cells in clinical field .\n",
        "The risk of developing severe complications from an influenza virus infection is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis ( PsO means psoriasis ) and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . However , low influenza vaccination rates have been reported . The aim of this study was to determine vaccination rates in PsO means psoriasis compared to AD means atopic dermatitis patients and explore patient perceptions of vaccination . A multicenter cross-sectional study was performed in 327 and 98 adult patients with PsO means psoriasis and AD means atopic dermatitis , respectively . Data on vaccination , patient and disease characteristics , comorbidity , and patient perceptions was collected with a questionnaire . Medical records and vaccination certificates were reviewed . A total of 49.8 % of PsO means psoriasis and 32.7 % of AD means atopic dermatitis patients were vaccinated at some point , while in season 2018/2019 , 30.9 % and 13.3 % received an influenza vaccination , respectively . There were 96.6 % and 77.6 % of PsO means psoriasis and AD means atopic dermatitis patients who had an indication for influenza vaccination due to age , immunosuppressive therapy , comorbidity , occupation , and/or pregnancy . Multivariate regression analysis revealed higher age ( < i > p</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) and a history of bronchitis ( < i > p</i > = 0.023 ) as significant predictors of influenza vaccination in PsO means psoriasis patients . Considering that most patients had an indication for influenza vaccination , the rate of vaccinated patients was inadequately low .\n",
        "Chronic inflammatory skin diseases , such as atopic dermatitis , are caused by the accumulation of immune cells and the overproduction of chemokines , including CCL17 and CCL22 , due to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted from keratinocytes . In the present study , the inhibitory activity of HM-V on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)/interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines was examined in human keratinocytes ( HaCaTs ) and 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNCB)-induced chronic skin contact dermatitis animal models . Traditional Asian medicinal herb extracts mixture ( HM-V ) , which have been extensively used in Asian medicine , were utilized . In TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced HaCaTs , HM-V strongly inhibited mRNA and protein expression of CCL17 and CCL22 in a concentration-dependent manner . The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-6 was also inhibited . Therefore , localized administration of HM-V in the DNCB-induced animal model alleviated immune cell deposition and skin inflammation . The results indicate that HM-V exerts inhibitory effects on keratinocyte production of CCL17 and CCL22 . Furthermore , HM-V may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory skin diseases .\n",
        "Food allergies ( FAs means Food allergies ) potentially differ across cultures . All medical records of 534 children and adolescents with IgE-mediated FA over a 5-year period were reviewed to document the regional characteristics with regard to spectrum and outcome . According to their last visit , the most common FAs means Food allergies were tree nuts ( TNs means tree nuts ) ( 52.4 % ) , cow`s milk ( 27.3 % ) , seeds ( 24.7 % ) , egg white ( 23.2 % ) and peanuts ( 14.9 % ) . Hazelnut and Anacardia nuts were the most common etiologies for TN allergies , whereas lentils and chickpeas for legumes and sesame and pumpkin seed means seed for seeds were most common , respectively . TN allergy was in first place in school-age children ( 55.3 % ) and adolescents ( 57.1 % ) while in the second place in preschoolers ( 57.7 % ) after egg white ( 60 % ) . Of these 534 children , 59.2 % had at least one resolved FA ( mainly egg white , cow`s milk ) and 21 % had no residual FA during the study period . Emerging FAs means Food allergies ( fish , shellfish , fruit , TN and seed means seed ) after the age of 3 years was reported in 94 children . The prevalence of current asthma ( 22.3 % , 38.2 % , 40 % ) and allergic rhinitis ( 11.6 % , 45.2 % , 60 % ) increased , while current atopic dermatitis ( 17.5 % , 8.6 % , 8,6 % ) decreased in preschoolers , school age children and adolescents , respectively . The FA spectrum of Turkish children and adolescents differs from many regions of the world with high rates of TN ( hazelnut , Anacardia nuts ) , seed means seed ( sesame , pumpkin seed means seed ) and lentils , and low rates of soy , peanut and seafood allergies . However , resolution , emergence and persistence of allergies and comorbidities are similar , which points to the limited role of the environment in the outcome .\n",

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a systemic inflammatory condition that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease ( CVD means cardiovascular disease ) ; however , ongoing debate exists surrounding its direct association . We aimed to elucidate whether AD means Atopic dermatitis contributes to a higher incidence of CVD means cardiovascular disease and major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE means major adverse cardiovascular events ) in adult patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , independent of metabolic disorders . We retrospectively analyzed a large US-based population of patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis ( ≥ 18 years of age ) . Logistic regression estimated the risk of CVD means cardiovascular disease and MACE means major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , independent of metabolic disorders ( including diabetes , hypertension , and obesity ) . The odds ratio ( OR ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) for patients without metabolic disorders was 1.25 ( 1.13 , 1.39 ) for CVD means cardiovascular disease and 1.22 ( 1.01 , 1.47 ) for MACE means major adverse cardiovascular events . The OR ( 95 % CI ) for AD means Atopic dermatitis patients with metabolic disorders was 1.09 ( 1.07 , 1.12 ) for CVD means cardiovascular disease and 1.14 ( 1.09 , 1.18 ) for MACE means major adverse cardiovascular events . This trend was even more pronounced after long-term follow-up ( ≥ 3 years ) . Lifestyle and health behavioral factors of the subjects were not available in the dataset . The lack of control for these factors could potentially confound our results . Atopic dermatitis may contribute to the risk of developing CVD means cardiovascular disease and MACE means major adverse cardiovascular events in adults , independent of metabolic disorders .\n",

In the present study , the anti-inflammatory , anti-allergic , and skin-protective effects of saponarin were investigated to evaluate its usefulness as a functional ingredient in cosmetics . In lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 ( murine macrophage ) cells , saponarin ( 80 μM ) significantly inhibited cytokine expression , including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α , interleukin (IL)-1β , inducible nitric oxide synthase , and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 . Saponarin ( 80 μM ) also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK means extracellular signal-regulated kinase ) and p38 involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells . Saponarin ( 40 μM ) significantly inhibited β-hexosaminidase degranulation as well as the phosphorylation of signaling effectors ( Syk , phospholipase Cγ1 , ERK means extracellular signal-regulated kinase , JNK , and p38 ) and the expression of inflammatory mediators ( tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-13 , COX-2 , and FcεRIα/γ ) in DNP-IgE- and DNP-BSA-stimulated RBL-2H3 ( rat basophilic leukemia ) cells . In addition , saponarin ( 100 μM ) significantly inhibited the expression of macrophage-derived chemokine , thymus and activation-regulated chemokine , IL-33 , thymic stromal lymphopoietin , and the phosphorylation of signaling molecules ( ERK means extracellular signal-regulated kinase , p38 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 [ STAT1 ] ) in TNF-α- and interferon (IFN)-γ-stimulated HaCaT ( human immortalized keratinocyte ) cells . Saponarin ( 100 μM ) also significantly induced the expression of hyaluronan synthase-3 , aquaporin 3 , and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide ( LL-37 ) in HaCaT cells , which play an important role as skin barriers . Saponarin remarkably inhibited the essential factors involved in the inflammatory and allergic responses of RAW264.7 , RBL-2H3 , and HaCaT cells , and induced the expression of factors that function as physical and chemical skin barriers in HaCaT cells . Therefore , saponarin could potentially be used to prevent and relieve immune-related skin diseases , including atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common inflammatory dermatosis affecting up to 30 % of children and 10 % of adults worldwide . AD means Atopic dermatitis is primarily driven by an epidermal barrier defect which triggers immune dysregulation within the skin .

The 80 % methanol extract of < i > Machilus thunbergii</i > bark significantly inhibited the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( STAT5 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ) phosphorylation in human mast cell (HMC)-1 cells . Through activity-guided isolation , three lignans ( < b>1</b>-<b>3</b > ) were obtained and identified as (+)-galbelgin ( < b>1</b > ) , < i > meso</i>-dihydroguaiaretic acid ( < b>2</b > ) , and machilin A ( < b>3</b > ) . Among them , two lignans ( < b>1</b > and < b>2</b > ) significantly inhibited STAT5 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 phosphorylation and TSLP/TSLPR interaction , as determined by ELISA . Our results indicated that lignans isolated from < i > M. thunbergii</i > are a promising resource for the treatment of allergic diseases .\n",
        "In atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , skin inflammation is caused by complex interactions between genetic disposition and aberrant innate/adaptive immune responses . Toll-like receptors ( TLRs means Toll-like receptors ) are key molecules in the innate/adaptive immune response as they recognize various molecular motifs associated with pathogens . Among them , TLR8 is implicated in eczematous skin reactions . We investigated the combined therapeutic effects of TLR8 gene silencing by the bacterial delivery of miRNA . We used < i > Salmonella</i > as a vector to deliver TLR8 miRNA . The recombinant strain of < i > Salmonella enterica</i > subsp . < i > enterica</i > serovar Typhimurium ( ST means serovar Typhimurium ) expressing TLR8 miRNA ( ST-miRTLR8 ) was prepared for knockdown of TLR8 . After oral administration of ST-miRTLR8 into mice , we observed the cytokine levels , skin pathology and scratching behaviors in an AD-like mouse model . TLR8 down-regulation decreased macrophage-derived chemokine concentrations in activated human mast cells . Serum IgE and interleukin-4 production were suppressed whereas IFN-γ was induced after oral administration of ST-miRTLR8 . Scratching behaviors and skin inflammation were also improved . In addition , attenuated < i > S. typhimurium</i > safely accumulated in mouse macrophages and showed adjuvant effects . This study shows that the recombinant miRNA that expresses the TLR8 miRNA has therapeutic effects by suppressing Th2 inflammation . TLR gene modulation using miRNA via < i > Salmonella</i > vectors will thus have a double-protective effect in the treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Mast cells are activated upon immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated antigen stimulation , and release a wide variety of mediators , including histamine to trigger inflammatory responses . The surface expression levels of Fcε receptor I ( FcεRI means Fcε receptor I ) , a high affinity receptor of IgE , were found to be positively regulated by IgE. IgE could protect murine cultured mast cells from apoptotic cell death induced by the deprivation of interleukin-3 and a certain kind of IgE could activate immature mast cells in the absence of antigens , leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a transient increase in histamine synthesis . Histamine synthesis in mast cells was found to be required for the maturation of murine connective tissue-type mast cells , raising the possibility that IgE indirectly modulates local mast cell maturation . Although it remains controversial to what extent this concept of \" monomeric IgE effects \" could have relevance in the modulation of human mast cell functions , the therapeutic effects of anti-IgE antibodies might be accounted for in terms of the decreased serum IgE concentrations . Because drastic increases in serum IgE concentrations are often observed in patients with atopic dermatitis and chronic urticaria , a close investigation of the roles of IgE in mast cell maturation should contribute to development of novel therapeutic approaches for these inflammatory diseases .\n",
        "The rates of refractory pediatric psoriasis and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) have steadily risen over the last few decades , demanding newer and more effective therapies . This review aims to explore the reasons for resistant disease , as well as its management ; this includes the indications for , efficacy of , and safety of current therapies for refractory pediatric dermatologic disease . A PubMed search for key phrases was performed . Poor medication adherence is the most common cause of resistant disease and may be managed with techniques such as simplified treatment regimens , more follow-ups and educational workshops , as well as framing and tailoring . Once problems with adherence are ruled out , escalating treatment to stronger biologic therapy may be indicated . Development of anti-drug antibodies ( ADAs means anti-drug antibodies ) can cause patients ' disease to be refractory in the presence of potent biologics , which may be addressed with regular medication use or concomitant methotrexate . If patients with AD means atopic dermatitis fail to respond to biologic therapy , a biopsy to rule out mycosis fungoides , or patch testing to rule out allergic contact dermatitis , may be indicated . A limitation of this study is the absence of more techniques for the management of poor medication adherence . Managing medication adherence , escalating treatment when appropriate , and addressing possible anti-drug antibodies will help assure control and relief for patients with resistant disease .\n",
        "Itching is prevalent in children with skin disorders and associated with effects on their mood , quality of life , and social functioning . Surprisingly , there are no data on childhood prevalence of pruritus in the general population . The aim of this article is to explore the epidemiology , clinical manifestation , and treatment for itch ( pruritus ) in the pediatric population ( from infancy to adolescence ) , and to be helpful to primary care physicians who assess and diagnose pediatric patients with itching . In this study , we searched for specific keywords using PubMed and MEDLINE ( Ovid ) and , then , refined the retrieved searches for each cause and treatment . As a result of reviewing the literature , atopic dermatitis was shown to be the most common cause of itching , especially during infancy and through preschool . Not only skin disorders but also systemic diseases , drugs , and postburn states can predispose an individual to itching in childhood . There are traditional and newly developed treatment modalities for itching in pediatric patients . However , because the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of childhood are different from those of adults , the medications for itching have to be applied carefully for these age groups . There are many areas to be elucidated regarding the prevalence and objective assessment of pruritus in pediatric patients . Moreover , the safety profiles of medications in the pediatric population need to be better understood . Further studies to investigate itching in childhood are warranted .\n",
        "Vitamin D is a lipo-soluble hormone well known for its effects on calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism . Recently , there has been growing interest in the extraskeletal effects of vitamin D. In particular , recent studies have highlighted how vitamin D plays a fundamental role in immunomodulation processes in the context of both innate and adaptive immunity , with means without (CRSsNP consequent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effect in different immune-mediated pathologies , such as systemic sclerosis , psoriasis , atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis ; as well as in various pro-inflammatory processes affecting the airways , including chronic rhinosinusitis with means without (CRSsNP ( CRSwNP ) or without ( CRSsNP means chronic rhinosinusitis with (CRSwNP) or without ) nasal polyposis . We analyze the role of vitamin D in the genesis and progression of CRSwNP/sNP and its supplementation as a safe and valid therapeutic strategy capable of improving the clinical outcome of standard therapies .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is common inflammatory dermatosis , typically with chronic and recurrent course , which significantly reduces the quality of life . Sleep disturbances are considered to be remarkably burdensome ailments in patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , and are routinely included during assessment of disease severity . Therefore , endogenous substances engaged in the control of circadian rhythms might be important in pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis and , possibly , be used as biomarkers of disease severity or even in development of novel therapies . Melatonin ( MT means Melatonin ) , the indoleamine produced by pineal gland ( but also by multiple other tissues , including skin ) , plays a pivotal role in maintaining the sleep/wake homeostasis . Additionally , it possesses strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties , which might directly link chronic skin inflammation and sleep abnormalities characteristic of AD means Atopic dermatitis . The objective of this work is to systematically present and summarize the results of studies ( both experimental and clinical ) that investigated the role of MT means Melatonin in the AD means Atopic dermatitis , with a focus on the antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects of MT means Melatonin .\n",

        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder associated with heterogenous presentation and often immense patient burden . Safe , targeted treatment options are currently limited . We conducted a focused review of the published literature , including clinical trial results , case reports , and abstracts , as well as presentations from scientific meetings and data from industry press releases , to describe the use of topical and systemic janus kinase ( JAK means janus kinase ) inhibitors ( JAKi means JAK) inhibitors ) in the treatment AD . New topical JAKi means JAK) inhibitors include ruxolitinib ( JAK1/2 ) and delgocitinib ( pan-JAK ) . Ruxolitinib cream met all primary and secondary endpoints in phase 3 clinical trials for mild-to-moderate AD with minimal treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs means treatment-emergent adverse events ) . Delgocitinib ointment was recently approved in Japan for pediatric and adult AD . Oral JAKi means JAK) inhibitors include baricitinib ( JAK1/2 ) , abrocitinib ( JAK1-selective ) , and upadacitinib ( JAK1-selective ) . All three met primary and secondary endpoints across numerous trials for moderate-to-severe AD . TEAEs means treatment-emergent adverse events were mainly mild-to-moderate and included acne , nausea , headache , upper respiratory tract infection , and to a lesser degree , herpes infection and selected laboratory abnormalities . JAKi means JAK) inhibitors hold great promise as the next generation of targeted AD therapy . While their outstanding efficacy is balanced by a favorable safety profile in clinical trials , real-world data are needed to better understand long-term safety , durability , and treatment success .\n",
        "To determine the cutaneous effects of in utero and lactational exposure to the AHR ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i > p</i>-dioxin ( TCDD means 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin ) , pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed by gavage to a vehicle or 5 μg TCDD/kg body weight at embryonic day 12 and epidermal barrier formation and function were studied in their offspring from postnatal day 1 ( P1 means postnatal day 1 ) through adulthood . TCDD-exposed pups were born with acanthosis . This effect was AHR-dependent and subsided by P6 with no evidence of subsequent inflammatory dermatitis . The challenge of adult mice with MC903 showed similar inflammatory responses in control and treated animals , indicating no long-term immunosuppression to this chemical . Chloracne-like sebaceous gland hypoplasia and cyst formation were observed in TCDD-exposed P21 mice , with concomitant microbiome dysbiosis . These effects were reversed by P35 . CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression in the skin was increased in the exposed mice until P21 , then declined . Both CYP proteins co-localized with LRIG1-expressing progenitor cells at the infundibulum . CYP1B1 protein also co-localized with a second stem cell niche in the isthmus . These results indicate that this exposure to TCDD means 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin causes a chloracne-like effect without inflammation . Transient activation of the AhR , due to the shorter half-life of TCDD means 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin in mice , likely contributes to the reversibility of these effects .\n",
        "It is important to understand patients ' and dermatologists ' perceptions of various aspects of atopic dermatitis , but there is a lack of studies on quality of life and stakeholder viewpoints in this therapy area . The aim of this study was to compare patients ' and dermatologists ' viewpoints regarding the impact of atopic dermatitis that is uncontrolled by topical corticosteroids . Data were collected from 348 adult patients who responded to self-administered questionnaires , and 150 telephone interviews with the dermatologists who selected them . Patients and dermatologists reported both convergent and divergent assessments of the impact of atopic dermatitis and its treatment . Notable areas of agreement were regarding the safety of emollients , the time required and difficulty of applying topical corticosteroids , especially to certain parts of the body . Divergent views involved the perceived efficacy of available treatments and the impact of atopic dermatitis on professional life . A greater understanding of these differences would help dermatologists to optimize patient care .\n",
        "Atopic diseases are among the most common chronic conditions in childhood . Causes of allergies are manifold . The aim of this paper is to evaluate risk factors for atopic diseases and unremitting wheeze and to examine if there is an association between measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR means mumps and rubella ) vaccination and atopic dermatitis , asthma and unremitting wheeze in Bavarian pre-schoolers . Parents filled out a questionnaire on children 's health and environmental and socioeconomic factors . The questionnaire was administered within the Health Monitoring Units in a cross-sectional study in Bavaria , Germany ( 2014/2015 ) . Data on vaccinations were obtained via the School Entrance Examination , a mandatory examination for pre-school children in Bavaria . Rates of influential factors of atopic diseases and wheeze , MMR means mumps and rubella and DTP means diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus ( diphtheria , pertussis and tetanus ) vaccination were calculated for all children stratified by health outcomes . To examine if there is an association between MMR means mumps and rubella vaccination and health outcomes , a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed .

There were no significant associations between any of the health outcome groups and MMR means mumps and rubella vaccination in the multiple logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounders . The present study is in line with the current state of research that MMR means mumps and rubella vaccination is not associated with atopic diseases .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by pruritus , xerosis , and eczematous lesions . In Japan , treatment options , such as topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus , are associated with efficacy and safety concerns . Crisaborole ointment , 2 % , is a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent approved in several countries for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD means Atopic dermatitis . This phase 2b , randomized , double-blind study ( NCT03954158 ) assessed the efficacy and safety of two crisaborole regimens versus vehicle in the treatment of Japanese patients aged ≥2 years with mild-to-moderate AD means Atopic dermatitis . Each patient was assigned to one of two age cohorts ( ≥12 or 2 - 11 years ) and randomized to crisaborole once daily means daily (BID ( QD ) or twice daily means daily (BID ( BID ) . All patients had two target lesions that were each randomly assigned to crisaborole or vehicle at baseline and treated for 2 weeks . The primary endpoint was change from baseline in total sign score ( TSS means total sign score ) in crisaborole- or vehicle-treated target lesions on day 15 , and secondary endpoints included change from baseline in Investigator 's Static Global Assessment ( ISGA means Investigator's Static Global Assessment ) and pruritic assessments ( Cohort 1 : peak pruritus numeric rating scale [ NRS ] ; Cohort 2 : Itch Severity Scale Self-Report and Caregiver-Reported Itch Severity NRS ) and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs means treatment-emergent adverse events ) . This study comprised 81 patients ( Cohort 1 : n = 41 ; Cohort 2 : n = 40 ) . Crisaborole-treated lesions showed statistically significant reductions in TSS means total sign score versus vehicle-treated lesions at day 15 ( p & lt ; 0.01 ) , and numerically larger decreases in TSS means total sign score were observed with crisaborole BID versus crisaborole QD in both cohorts . Furthermore , crisaborole-treated lesions generally demonstrated greater decreases in ISGA means Investigator's Static Global Assessment , peak pruritus NRS , Itch Severity Scale , and Caregiver-Reported Itch Severity NRS versus vehicle-treated lesions irrespective of regimen or cohort . Overall , TEAEs means treatment-emergent adverse events were mild ; the most frequently reported TEAEs means treatment-emergent adverse events was application site irritation . In summary , both crisaborole regimens , particularly crisaborole BID , demonstrated efficacy and were well tolerated .\n",
        "Dupilumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-4Rα , has demonstrated rapid and sustained improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , asthma , and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps . In a phase 1 , double-blind , ascending-dose study , 30 healthy Chinese adults were randomized to single subcutaneous doses of dupilumab 200 , 300 , 600 mg , or placebo . In a phase 3 , double-blind study , 165 Chinese adults with AD means atopic dermatitis were randomized to dupilumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks . Following single doses of dupilumab 200 , 300 , and 600 mg in the phase 1 study , mean serum maximum concentrations ( C < sub > max</sub > ) were 25.4 ± 4.0 , 37.2 ± 14.5 , and 77.3 ± 19.0 mg/L , respectively . For a 1.5-fold increase in dupilumab dose , 1.31- , 1.73- , and 1.66-fold increases in C < sub > max</sub > , area under the curve to real time ( AUC < sub > last</sub > ) , and extrapolated to infinity ( AUC ) were observed , respectively , while a 2-fold dose increase resulted in 2.17- , 2.81- , and 2.80-fold increases , respectively . In the phase 3 study , mean dupilumab trough concentrations were 78.8 ± 32.0 and 86.4 ± 33.6 mg/L at weeks 12 and 16 , respectively . C < sub > max</sub > increased approximately proportionally to dose , while AUC and AUC < sub > last</sub > increased greater than proportionally . Dupilumab pharmacokinetics were generally comparable between Chinese and non-Asian healthy subjects ( single dose ) and between Chinese and non-Asian AD means atopic dermatitis patients ( repeated doses ) , with differences accounted for by body weight . As differences in exposure by weight are unlikely to be clinically relevant based on late-stage study results , no dose adjustment by ethnic origin or weight is required .\n",
        "Lymphomatoid papulosis ( LyP means Lymphomatoid papulosis ) is a chronic , recurrent benign skin disease characterized by histological features of a CD 30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder . It is rare , with an annual , worldwide incidence of 1.2 - 1.9 per million , and accounts for 16 - 47 % of pediatric cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders . It often occurs on the extremities or the trunk and rarely affects the face or genitals . Its onset may be triggered by irradiation therapy , immunomodulating agents , infection or atopic dermatitis . It has a benign course but is associated with certain hematological malignancies . Mycosis fungoides and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma are the most commonly associated hematological malignancies . The incidence of lymphoma in children with LyP means Lymphomatoid papulosis has been reported to be 8.5 % at most . Most patients who develop lymphomas do so within 4 years of the LyP means Lymphomatoid papulosis onset ; therefore , patients with LyP means Lymphomatoid papulosis should be carefully followed up .

        "Allergic skin inflammation requires the influx of inflammatory cells into the skin . Extravasation of leukocytes into the skin requires interactions between endothelial selectins and their glycan ligands on the surface of leukocytes . Selectin-ligand formation requires the activity of several glycosyltransferases , including < i > Fut7</i > In this report , we tested the importance of < i > Fut7</i > for the development of allergic skin inflammation in the Stat6VT transgenic mouse model . We observed that < i > Fut7</i > deficiency was protective but did not eliminate disease . Segregation of the data by gender of the parent that transmitted the Stat6VT transgene , but not by gender of the pups , which were analyzed for disease , revealed that the protective effects of < i > Fut7</i > deficiency were significantly greater when dams were Stat6VT negative . In contrast , in mice from litters of Stat6VT < sup>+</sup > dams , < i > Fut7</i > deficiency resulted in only modest protection . These findings indicate that pups from atopic dams exhibit a greater propensity for allergic disease , similar to observations in humans , and that the effect of maternal atopy is due to enhanced selectin-independent mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment in their offspring . Together , these results demonstrate that < i > Fut7</i > deficiency can be protective in a model of atopic dermatitis but that maternal atopy diminishes these protective effects , suggesting alternative pathways for leukocyte recruitment in the absence of < i > Fut7</i > enzyme activity . These observations have implications for understanding how the environment in utero predisposes for the development of allergic disease .\n",

        "Atopy is defined as the genetic predisposition to react with type I allergic diseases such as food- , skin- , and respiratory allergies . Distinct molecular mechanisms have been described , including the known Th2 driven immune response . IL-17A ( IL-17 ) is mainly produced by Th17 cells and belongs to the IL-17 family of cytokines , IL-17A to F. While IL-17 plays a major role in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders , more data was published in recent years elucidating the role of IL-17 in allergic diseases . The present study aimed to elaborate specifically the role of IL-17 in atopy . A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE , Embase , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , regarding IL-17 and atopy/allergic diseases . In total , 31 novel publications could be identified ( food allergy < i > n</i > = 3 , allergic asthma < i > n</i > = 7 , allergic rhinitis [ AR ] < i > n</i > = 10 , atopic dermatitis [ AD ] < i > n</i > = 11 ) . In all allergic diseases , the IL-17 pathway has been investigated . Serum IL-17 was elevated in all allergic diseases . In AR , serum and nasal IL-17 levels correlated with the severity of the disease . In food allergies , serum IL-17E was also elevated in children . In AD , there is a trend for higher IL-17 values in the serum and skin specimen , while it is more expressed in acute lesions . In allergic asthma , serum IL-17 levels were increased . In two studies , higher serum IL-17 levels were found in severe persistent asthmatic patients than in intermittent asthmatics or healthy controls . Only one therapeutic clinical study exists on allergic diseases ( asthma patients means asthmatic patients than in intermittent asthmatics or healthy controls. Only one therapeutic clinical study exists on allergic diseases patients ) using a monoclonal antibody against the IL-17 receptor A. No clinical efficacy was found in the total study population , except for a subgroup of patients with ( post-bronchodilator ) high reversibility . The role of IL 17 in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases is evident , but the involvement of the Th17 cytokine in the pathophysiological pathway is not conclusively defined . IL-17 is most likely relevant and will be a clinical target in subgroups of patients . The current data indicates that IL-17 is elevated more often in acute and severe forms of allergic diseases .\n",
        "Inborn errors of immunity are traditionally best known for enhancing susceptibility to infections . However , allergic inflammation , among other types of immune dysregulation , occurs frequently in patients with inborn errors of immunity . As such , the term primary atopic disorders ( PADs means primary atopic disorders ) was recently coined to describe the group of heritable monogenic allergic disorders . It is becoming increasingly important for clinicians to recognize that allergic diseases such as food allergy , atopic dermatitis , and allergic asthma are expressions of misdirected immunity , and in patients who present with severe , early-onset , or coexisting allergic conditions , these can be indications of an underlying PAD . Identifying monogenic allergic disease through next-generation sequencing can dramatically improve outcomes by allowing the use of precision-based therapy targeting the patient 's underlying molecular defect . It is therefore imperative that clinicians recognize PADs means primary atopic disorders to be able to provide informed therapeutic options and improve patient outcomes . Here , we summarize the clinical features commonly seen with each of the currently known PADs means primary atopic disorders , identify clinical warning signs that warrant assessment for PADs means primary atopic disorders , and lastly , discuss the benefits of timely diagnosis and management of these conditions .\n",
        "Allergic diseases like asthma , allergic rhinitis , food allergy , hymenoptera allergy , or atopic dermatitis are highly prevalent in women of childbearing age and may affect up to 30 % of this age group . This review focuses on the management of allergic diseases during pregnancy . Furthermore , we discuss the challenges of counseling women with allergic diseases in the reproductive age , including considerations relevant to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic . To create the optimal milieu for the unborn child , a multitude of immunological changes occur during pregnancy which may favor type 2 responses and aggravate disease phenotypes . In co-occurrence with suboptimal preconception disease control , this elevated Th2 responses may aggravate allergic disease manifestations during pregnancy and pose a risk for mother and child . Due to limitations in conducting clinical trials in pregnant women , safety data on anti-allergic drugs during pregnancy are limited . The lack of information and concerns among pregnant patients demands counseling on the benefits of anti-allergic drugs and the potential and known risks . This includes information on the risk for mother and child of disease aggravation in the absence of treatment . By doing so , informed decisions and shared decision-making can take place .\n",

        "The globally increasing prevalence of chronic inflammatory skin diseases has substantial costs . Biologicals have become available as therapeutic options , but are encumbered with barriers to prescription . The aim of this study was to evaluate the barriers to prescription of biologicals in the treatment of chronic dermatological diseases . Dermatologists working in private practices in the German federal states of Bavaria and Lower Saxony participated in a cross-sectional study . Economic and legal aspects , including \" high therapy costs \" , \" low reimbursements \" , and \" fear of regress claims \" , were identified as the most prevalent barriers . Significant differences between dermatologists from Bavaria and Lower Saxony were found only regarding the treatment of atopic dermatitis . This study demonstrates the prevalence of barriers to the prescription of biologicals in the treatment of chronic dermatological diseases . Overcoming these barriers could improve the usage of modern therapies and thereby expand patient-centred care for chronic skin diseases .\n",

To investigate the relationship between atopic dermatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus . Systematic review and meta-analysis . A systematic review was conducted on EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from inception to March 2020 using a search strategy that consisted of terms related to AD means atopic dermatitis and SLE means systemic lupus erythematosus . Eligible study must be either cohort or case-control study .

The case-control study meta-analysis found a significantly increased odds of SLE means systemic lupus erythematosus among patients with AD means atopic dermatitis with the pooled odds ratio of 1.46 ( 95 % CI , 1.05 - 2.04 ) . A significant association between AD means atopic dermatitis and increased odds of SLE means systemic lupus erythematosus was observed by this systematic review and meta-analysis .\n",
        "Particulate matter ( PM means Particulate matter ) is a mixture of solid and liquid particles suspended in air which originates from industrial plants or vehicle emission . Although skin primarily contacts with air pollutants , the associations between PM means Particulate matter and chronic inflammatory skin diseases has not been well established . To investigate associations between PM means Particulate matter and atopic dermatitis as well as other chronic inflammatory dermatoses using Korea Health Insurance Review & amp ; Assessment Service data . Monthly disease statistics from seven largest cities ( Seoul , Busan , Daegu , Incheon , Gwangju , Daejeon , Ulsan ) and Jeju Island of South Korea of 23,288,000 people were included . Based on daily air pollution level and weather forecast from 2015 to 2019 , multivariate negative binomial regression analysis was conducted to estimate monthly visits of atopic dermatitis with respect to outdoor air pollutants ( PM means Particulate matter < sub>2.5</sub > , PM means Particulate matter < sub>10</sub > , O < sub>3</sub > , NO < sub>2,</sub > SO < sub>2</sub > , CO ) . Every 10 μg/m < sup>3</sup > increase in PM means Particulate matter < sub>2.5</sub > and PM means Particulate matter < sub>10</sub > was significantly associated with 2.71 % ( 95 % confidence interval (CI)=0.76%-4.71 % ; P = 0.0063 ) and 2.01 % ( 95 % CI=0.92%-3.11 % , P = 0.0003 ) increase in monthly patient visits of atopic dermatitis , respectively . Every 1 ppb increase in SO < sub>2</sub > and 100 ppb increase in CO was significantly associated with 2.26 % ( 95 % CI=1.35%-3.17 % ; P & lt ; 0.0001 ) and 2.86 % ( 95 % CI=1.35%-4.40 % ; P = 0.0002 ) increase in patient visits of atopic dermatitis , respectively , while O < sub>3</sub > and NO < sub>2</sub > were not associated . On the other hand , increases in PM means Particulate matter < sub>2.5</sub > and PM means Particulate matter < sub>10</sub > concentrations were significantly associated with increases of patient visits of psoriasis , seborrheic dermatitis , and rosacea . Our data suggest PM means Particulate matter is associated with atopic dermatitis and chronic inflammatory skin diseases .\n",
        "The diagnosis and management of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) is extensively addressed in detailed clinical guidelines . However , the high heterogeneity regarding presentation and progression and the increasingly broad therapeutic landscape suggest a complex real-world scenario , leading to multiple trajectories of AD means atopic dermatitis patients . Using a Delphi methodology for assessing the degree of consensus , we explored the views of a panel of dermatologists regarding the patients ' trajectory through the diagnosis ( block 1 ) , treatment ( block 2 ) , and long-term management ( block 3 ) of AD means atopic dermatitis . Based on a systematic search of the literature , a scientific committee prepared a questionnaire of relevant items that were rated on a 10-point scale ( from \" totally agree \" to \" totally disagree \" ) by a panel of dermatologists attending patients with AD means atopic dermatitis in the hospital setting . Consensus was established based on predefined rules . The final questionnaire included 58 items and was answered by 17 dermatologists . Overall , consensus was reached on 22 items ( 37.9 % ) , each of which was a consensus for agreement . The consensus rates in blocks 1 , 2 , and 3 were 22.7 % , 19.0 % , and 86 % , respectively . Our analysis revealed a remarkable lack of consensus on various aspects of the routine diagnosis and treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis . These findings suggest the presence of unmet needs or limited implementation of guidelines for the management of AD means atopic dermatitis and encourage further research to explore the causes of this low consensus on the management of AD means atopic dermatitis in the real-world setting .\n",

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory and pruritic skin disease , affecting 10 - 20 % of the population worldwide . Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews ( Paeoniaceae ) ( Cortex Moutan ) and Mentha haplocalyx Briq . ( Labiatae ) ( Herba Menthae ) have shown beneficial effects on AD means Atopic dermatitis . Calendula officinalis L. ( Asteraceae ) is commonly used for treating skin rashes and wounds . In the present study , a three-herbs formula including Cortex Moutan and Herba Menthae , together with C. officinalis at 1:1:1 weight ratio was used as a topical agent and its therapeutic effects on AD means Atopic dermatitis was investigated . In vitro effects of individual herbs and three-herbs formula ( 0.125 - 1 mg/ml ) were examined using cytokine release assay on human mast HMC-1 cells , inflammation test on murine macrophage RAW cells and human keratinocyte ( HaCaT ) cells , and migration scratch assay on human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC means human umbilical vein endothelial cells ) . The contributing functional pathway of three-herbs formula in AD means Atopic dermatitis was explored using Western Blot assay in HMC-1 cells . Oxazolone-induced AD-like mice model was also used to investigate the in vivo therapeutic effect of the topical application of the three-herbs formula . Herba Menthae , Cortex Moutan , and three-herbs formula significantly reduced the production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in HMC-1 cells , inhibited the expression of IL-6 , IL-8 and CCL2 in TNF-α/IFN-γ stimulated HaCaT cells , and suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide ( NO means nitric oxide ) production in RAW 264.7 cells . Moreover , Herba Menthae and three-herbs formula significantly suppressed CCL2 and TNF-α production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells . C. officinalis and three-herbs formula promoted wound healing in HUVEC means human umbilical vein endothelial cells . For intracellular mechanisms , three-herbs formula inhibited the expressions of molecules in STAT1 and STAT3-dependent pathways . In vivo model showed that topical application of three-herbs formula on challenged ear reduced ear swelling and mice scratching frequencies . H&amp;E and toluidine blue staining of the challenged ear tissue demonstrated that three-herbs formula reduced the epidermal thickness and mast cell infiltration , respectively . The three-herbs formula of Cortex Moutan , Herba Menthae and C. officinalis at 1:1:1 ( w/w ) exhibited anti-inflammatory effect and promotion of cell migration in vitro . It also alleviated ear redness , swelling , epidermal thickness and inflammation of the OXA-induced AD means Atopic dermatitis mice . These findings suggest a potential beneficial role of the topical application of the three-herbs formula for treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common , chronic dermatosis , with onset of disease often manifesting in early infancy . Past studies evaluating the early use of moisturisers in the prevention of AD means Atopic dermatitis had mixed results . To compare the incidence of moderate or severe AD means Atopic dermatitis and total incidence of AD means Atopic dermatitis in a cohort of ' at-risk ' infants treated with moisturisers from the first 2 weeks of life , to a similar group without moisturisers . We performed a single-centre , prospective , parallel-group , randomised study in infants with at least 2 first-degree relatives with atopy . Subjects were randomised into either a treatment group with moisturisers or a control group without moisturisers . Participants were assessed at 2 , 6 , and 12 months for AD means Atopic dermatitis and if present , the severity was assessed using SCORAD index . We also compared the overall incidence of AD means Atopic dermatitis , trans-epidermal water loss ( TEWL means trans-epidermal water loss ) , stratum corneum ( SC means stratum corneum ) hydration , pH , and incidence of food and environmental sensitisation and allergies between both groups . Genotyping for loss-of-functions mutations in the FLG gene was conducted . A total of 200 subjects were recruited , with 100 subjects in each arm . There was no significant difference in incidence of moderate or severe AD means Atopic dermatitis , and total incidence of AD means Atopic dermatitis at 12 months between the treatment and control groups . There was a lower mean SCORAD in the treatment group than in the control group , but no significant difference in TEWL means trans-epidermal water loss , SC means stratum corneum hydration , and skin pH. No significant side-effects were reported . The early use of moisturisers in ' at-risk ' infants does not reduce the incidence of moderate-to-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis and overall incidence of AD means Atopic dermatitis in infancy .\n",
        "< b > Background:</b > Benzo[a]pyrene ( BaP means Benzo[a]pyrene ) affects the immune system and causes mutagenic and carcinogenic effects . < b > Purpose:</b > We aimed to evaluate the effects of systemic exposure to BaP means Benzo[a]pyrene on mite allergen-induced atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin lesions in mice . < b > Methods:</b > Mite allergen ( < i > Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</i > ; Dp ) was injected intradermally into the right ears of NC/Nga male mice on eight occasions every 2 - 3 days . Benzo[a]pyrene was administered intraperitoneally in the equivalent doses of 0 , 2 , 20 , 200 , or 2000 μg/kg/day , once a week on four occasions . < b > Results:</b > AD-like skin inflammation related to mite allergen worsened by BaP means Benzo[a]pyrene exposure at 2 , 20 µg/kg/day doses ; this was in parallel with eosinophil and mast cell infiltration and mast cell degranulation . A trend was also observed toward increased proinflammatory molecule expression , including macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha , interleukin (IL)-4 , IL-13 , and IL-18 , in the ear tissue . However , 200 or 2000 µg/kg/day BaP means Benzo[a]pyrene attenuated the enhancing effects . In the regional lymph nodes , 2 µg/kg/day BaP means Benzo[a]pyrene with Dp enhanced antigen-presenting cell and T cell activation compared with Dp alone . < b > Conclusions:</b > This suggests that BaP means Benzo[a]pyrene exposure can aggravate Dp-induced AD-like skin lesions through T < sub > H</sub>2-biased responses in the inflamed sites and the activation of regional lymph nodes . Therefore , BaP means Benzo[a]pyrene may be responsible for the recent increase in AD incidence .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic heterogeneous condition characterized by erythematous , pruritic , and inflamed skin . Janus kinase ( JAK means Janus kinase ) inhibitors are a new class of drugs that target proteins in the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription ( JAK-STAT means Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription ) pathway . These drugs can be administered orally or topically to inhibit signaling of the JAK-STAT means Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway and minimize the production of proinflammatory cytokines . The efficacy and safety of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors have been investigated in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for AD means Atopic dermatitis . The safety of new medications , which are immunosuppressive by nature , is of utmost concern for the prescriber and patient alike . Herein we summarize the safety results of clinical trials using oral abrocitinib , upadacitinib , and baricitinib , as well as topical ruxolitinib and delgocitinib for the treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis . The most prevalent ( 2 - 5 % occurrence rate ) treatment-emergent adverse events from oral JAK means Janus kinase inhibitor use in AD means Atopic dermatitis were nausea , upper respiratory tract infection , headache , herpes zoster , herpes simplex , acne , increased blood creatine phosphokinase levels , and decreased platelet counts . Topical JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors were not associated with systemic effects . All studies reported that JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors were well tolerated in patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis in comparison with the control group . While the use of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors in patients suffering from AD means Atopic dermatitis is very promising , trials reported to date are of short duration ( maximum 16 weeks ) , and more information on the long-term safety of these novel agents is required .\n",
        "The \" epithelial barrier hypothesis \" proposes that the exposure to various epithelial barrier-damaging agents linked to industrialization and urbanization underlies the increase in allergic diseases . The epithelial barrier constitutes the first line of physical , chemical , and immunological defense against environmental factors . Recent reports have shown that industrial products disrupt the epithelial barriers . Innate and adaptive immune responses play an important role in epithelial barrier damage . In addition , recent studies suggest that epithelial barrier dysfunction plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the atopic march by allergen sensitization through the transcutaneous route . It is evident that external factors interact with the immune system , triggering a cascade of complex reactions that damage the epithelial barrier . Epigenetic and microbiome changes modulate the integrity of the epithelial barrier . Robust and simple measurements of the skin barrier dysfunction at the point-of-care are of significant value as a biomarker , as recently reported using electrical impedance spectroscopy to directly measure barrier defects . Understanding epithelial barrier dysfunction and its mechanism is key to developing novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases . The aim of this review is to summarize recent studies on the pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by environmental factors that contribute to the dysregulation of epithelial barrier function .\n",
        "Clinically and pathologically , the patients with hyper-IgE syndrome present similar skin manifestations to common atopic dermatitis . The original hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by diminished inflammatory response , in combination with Staphylococcus aureus skin abscess and pneumonia followed by pneumatocele formation . These immunological manifestations are frequently associated with skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities . We previously identified that major causal variants of the hyper-IgE syndrome are dominant negative variants in the STAT3 . In addition to the identification of new causative variants for the disorders similar to the original hyper-IgE syndrome , causative variants for new types of hyper-IgE syndrome centered only on atopy , high serum IgE levels , and susceptibility to infection , but not associated with diminished inflammatory response , pneumatocele formation , and connective tissue manifestations , have been identified . Recent discovery identified a novel zinc finger protein that regulates STAT3 transcription . Investigation of IL6ST variants disclosed that IL6ST/IL6R cytokine receptor plays a crucial role for the signal transduction upstream of STAT3 in the pathogenesis of the original hyper-IgE syndrome . Even if the same IL6ST variants are used for the signal transduction of IL-6 family cytokines , the signaling defect is more severe in IL-6/IL-11 and milder in LIF . The fact that the non-immune manifestations of the gain-of-function mutations of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are similar to the those of dominant negative mutations of STAT3 provide a clue to elucidate molecular mechanisms of non-immune manifestations of hyper-IgE syndrome . Research on this hereditary atopic syndrome is being actively conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and to develop new therapeutic approaches .\n",

        "Mechanical alloknesis ( or innocuous mechanical stimuli-evoked itch ) often occurs in dry skin-based disorders such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis . However , the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying mechanical alloknesis remain unclear . We recently reported the involvement of CD26 in the regulation of psoriatic itch . This molecule exhibits dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPPIV means dipeptidyl peptidase IV ) enzyme activity and exerts its biologic effects by processing various substances , including neuropeptides . The aim of the present study was to investigate the peripheral mechanisms of mechanical alloknesis by using CD26/DPPIV knockout ( CD26KO means CD26/DPPIV knockout ) mice . We applied innocuous mechanical stimuli to CD26KO means CD26/DPPIV knockout or wild-type mice . The total number of scratching responses was counted as the alloknesis score . Immunohistochemical and behavioral pharmacologic analyses were then performed to examine the physiologic activities of CD26/DPPIV or endomorphins ( EMs means endomorphins ) , endogenous agonists of μ-opioid receptors . Mechanical alloknesis was more frequent in CD26KO means CD26/DPPIV knockout mice than in wild-type mice . The alloknesis score in CD26KO means CD26/DPPIV knockout mice was significantly reduced by the intradermal administration of recombinant DPPIV means dipeptidyl peptidase IV or naloxone methiodide , a peripheral μ-opioid receptor antagonist , but not by that of mutant DPPIV means dipeptidyl peptidase IV without enzyme activity . EMs means endomorphins ( EM-1 and EM-2 ) , selective ligands for μ-opioid receptors , are substrates for DPPIV means dipeptidyl peptidase IV . Immunohistochemically , EMs means endomorphins were located in keratinocytes , fibroblasts , and peripheral sensory nerves . Behavioral analyses revealed that EMs means endomorphins preferentially provoked mechanical alloknesis over chemical itch . DPPIV-digested forms of EMs means endomorphins did not induce mechanical alloknesis . The present results suggest that EMs means endomorphins induce mechanical alloknesis at the periphery under the enzymatic control of CD26/DPPIV .\n",
        "In recent years , landmark clinical trials investigating the role of early oral exposure to food antigens for food allergy ( FA means food allergy ) prevention have highlighted the importance of immunoregulatory pathways in the ' gut-skin axis ' . This review highlights recent literature on the mechanisms of the immune system and microbiome involved in the gut-skin axis , contributing to the development of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , FA means food allergy , allergic rhinitis ( AR means allergic rhinitis ) and asthma . Therapeutic interventions harnessing the gut-skin axis are also discussed . Epicutaneous sensitization in the presence of AD means atopic dermatitis is capable of inducing Th2 allergic inflammation in the intestinal tract and lower respiratory airways , predisposing one to the development of AR means allergic rhinitis and asthma . Probiotics have demonstrated positive effects in preventing and treating AD means atopic dermatitis , though there is no evident relationship of its beneficial effects on other allergic diseases . Prophylactic skin emollients use has not shown consistent protection against AD means atopic dermatitis , whereas there is some evidence for the role of dietary changes in alleviating AD means atopic dermatitis and airway inflammation . More randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the potential of epicutaneous immunotherapy as a therapeutic strategy for patients with FA means food allergy . The growing understanding of the gut-skin interactions on allergic disease pathogenesis presents novel avenues for therapeutic interventions which target modulation of the gut and/or skin .\n",

At 16 weeks , the improvement in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure scores ranked abrocitinib 200 mg daily the highest ( LSM means least square means differences -7.62 , 95 % Crl means credible intervals -10.26 ; -4.98 ) and improvement in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ranked dupilumab 300 mg once weekly highest ( LSM means least square means differences -2.98 , 95 % Crl means credible intervals -4.48 ; -1.47 ) The improvement in peak pruritus scores ranked lebrikizumab 250 mg fortnightly ( LSM means least square means differences -64.90 , 95 % Crl-84.58 ; -45.22 ) highest.<b > Conclusion:</b > The present study suggests that there are various systemic options for AD means atopic dermatitis for which all seem to demonstrate a degree of QoL-related efficacy .\n",
        "Trisomy 21 has known associated clinical phenotypes , including skin and soft tissue concerns . However , the overall prevalence and types of findings are largely unclear . A retrospective review of children with trisomy 21 and one or more dermatologic diagnoses , seen from 1/1/1994 to 7/1/2016 , was performed to record dermatologic diagnoses . If one or more diagnoses were confirmed , further data were collected , including demographics , medical specialty , referrals to dermatology , treatment , complications , and follow-up . One hundred and seventy-four patients with a diagnosis of trisomy 21 aged 18 years or younger were confirmed to have one or more dermatologic diagnoses . In a total of 479 dermatologic diagnoses , superficial mycoses ( 12 % ) , skin and soft tissue infections ( 10 % ) , dermatitis ( 8 % ) , and folliculitis ( 8 % ) were most common . Diagnoses were most commonly made as an outpatient ( 91 % ) and by general pediatrics ( 45 % ) or dermatology ( 25 % ) . A significant difference ( P & lt ; .05 ) in the frequency of various diagnoses made by different specialties was observed . A significant difference ( P & lt ; .05 ) in the treatments recommended by different specialties was also observed . Referrals to dermatology were infrequent ( 6 % ) . However , a frequent change in diagnosis ( 61 % ) or treatment ( 68 % ) for patients referred to dermatology was observed . Children with trisomy 21 are most commonly diagnosed with superficial mycoses , skin and soft tissue infections , dermatitis , and folliculitis . The majority of diagnoses were made by general pediatricians and although dermatology referral was rarely necessary , consultations often resulted in change of diagnosis and/or treatment , supporting consideration of early and frequent dermatology referral .\n",
        "Although atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) is becoming a pressing public health concern in the world , Madagascar is underrepresented in the AD means atopic dermatitis literature . We aimed to study the demographic and clinical pattern of AD means atopic dermatitis in adult dermatology outpatients . A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Dermatology , University Hospital , Antananarivo , Madagascar . Patients & gt;15 years old with a registered diagnosis of AD means atopic dermatitis , from January 2010 to February 2019 , were included . AD means atopic dermatitis was diagnosed by a dermatologist according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria . The severity of AD means atopic dermatitis was assessed using scoring atopic dermatitis ( SCORAD means scoring atopic dermatitis ) . Forty-two cases of AD means atopic dermatitis were included . The prevalence was 0.5 % . The median patient age was 37 years . The age of onset of AD means atopic dermatitis was before the age of 15 years in 38 % of the patients and after the age of 15 years in 61.9 % of the patients . There was a female preponderance ( female to male ratio , 2:1 ) , but no correlation was found between sex and the severity of AD means atopic dermatitis . People living in urban areas were the most affected . According to SCORAD means scoring atopic dermatitis , 37 cases presented moderate AD means atopic dermatitis and 2 cases presented severe AD means atopic dermatitis .

        "Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS means Hidradenitis suppurativa ) and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) are both chronic inflammatory skin diseases . An association between these 2 conditions can have important potential implications for elucidating pathogenesis , disease course , and treatment . To investigate the association between AD means atopic dermatitis and HS means Hidradenitis suppurativa . We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients seen at Duke University Medical Center from 2007 to 2017 who had AD means atopic dermatitis compared with a control group without an AD means atopic dermatitis diagnosis . The association of AD means atopic dermatitis and HS means Hidradenitis suppurativa was evaluated using a logistic regression model after adjusting for other confounders including age , sex , and race . Of 28,780 patients with an AD means atopic dermatitis diagnosis , 325 ( 1.1 % ) were diagnosed with HS means Hidradenitis suppurativa compared with 76 ( 0.2 % ) within the 48,383 patients in the non-AD group .

        "Although dupilumab has been associated with the development of conjunctivitis , little is known about other ocular surface disorders such as dry eye and how these side effects are managed . To evaluate the incidence and management of ocular surface disorders , including dry eye and conjunctivitis , among patients treated with dupilumab . Using US claims data , we evaluated the incidence of encounters for ocular surface disorders among patients treated with dupilumab . Secondary outcomes included ophthalmic medication use . A propensity score matched , active-comparator , new-user cohort design was used to compare the incidence of ocular surface disorders between those starting dupilumab versus methotrexate . Among those with a history of atopic dermatitis , encounters for ocular surface disorders were more common in the 6 months after starting dupilumab than in the 6 months prior ( 11.7 % versus 8.7 % , < i > P</i > & lt ; .001 ) ; 59.7 % of those with a new ocular surface disorder diagnosis filled a prescription for an ophthalmic medication .

Forty-two ( 51 % ) of 82 Councilors and Associates of the International Eczema Council ( IEC means International Eczema Council ) , an international group with expertise in AD means Atopic dermatitis , responded to an electronic survey on TPE means Therapeutic patient education and AD means Atopic dermatitis . Most respondents ( 97.5 % ) agreed that TPE means Therapeutic patient education should play an important role in the management of AD means Atopic dermatitis . Many respondents ( 82.9 % ) believed that all patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , regardless of disease severity , could benefit from TPE means Therapeutic patient education . The International Eczema Council survey lacks specific information on AD means Atopic dermatitis severity . Publications have shown the positive effect of TPE means Therapeutic patient education on the course of the disease , the prevention of complications , and the autonomy and quality of patient life . Survey respondents agreed that TPE means Therapeutic patient education can improve the quality of patient care and patient satisfaction with care .\n",
        "Complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM means Complementary and alternative medicine ) treatments are growing in popularity as alternative treatments for common skin conditions . To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the tolerability and treatment response to CAM means Complementary and alternative medicine treatments in acne , atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , and psoriasis . PubMed/Medline and Embase databases were searched to identify eligible studies measuring the effects of CAM means Complementary and alternative medicine in acne , AD means atopic dermatitis , and psoriasis . Effect size with 95 % confidence interval ( CI means confidence interval ) was estimated using the random-effect model . The search yielded 417 articles ; 40 studies met the inclusion criteria . The quantitative results of CAM means Complementary and alternative medicine treatment showed a standard mean difference ( SMD means standard mean difference ) of 3.78 ( 95 % CI means confidence interval [ -0.01 , 7.57 ] ) and 0.58 ( 95 % CI means confidence interval [ -6.99 , 8.15 ] ) in the acne total lesion count , a SMD means standard mean difference of -0.70 ( 95 % CI means confidence interval [ -1.19 , -0.21 ] ) in the eczema area and severity index score and a SMD means standard mean difference of 0.94 ( 95 % CI means confidence interval [ -0.83 , 2.71 ] ) in the scoring of atopic dermatitis score for AD means atopic dermatitis , and a SMD means standard mean difference of 3.04 ( 95 % CI means confidence interval [ -0.35 , 6.43 ] ) and 5.16 ( 95 % CI means confidence interval [ -0.52 , 10.85 ] ) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index score for psoriasis . Differences between the study designs , sample sizes , outcome measures , and treatment durations limit the generalizability of data . Based on our quantitative findings we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy and the recommendation of CAM means Complementary and alternative medicine for acne , AD means atopic dermatitis , and psoriasis .\n",
        "Skin diseases have a significant global impact on quality of life , mental health , and loss of income . The burden of dermatologic conditions and its relationship with socioeconomic status in Asia is currently not well understood . We selected Global Burden of Disease Study datasets to analyze disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs means disability-adjusted life years ) in 50 Asian countries , including Central Asia , northern Asia , eastern Asia , western Asia , southeastern Asia , and southern Asia , between 1990 and 2017 . We compared DALYs means disability-adjusted life years to the socioeconomic status using the sociodemographic index and gross domestic product per capita of a country . Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson 's correlation . Some countries had higher or lower than expected age-standardized DALY rates of skin diseases . Asian countries , especially high-income countries , had a high burden of inflammatory dermatoses , including acne , alopecia areata , atopic dermatitis , contact dermatitis , decubitus ulcers , psoriasis , pruritus , and seborrheic dermatitis . The burden of infectious dermatoses was greater in low-income Asian countries . The burden of skin cancer in Asia was relatively low . There is a high burden of skin disease , especially inflammatory conditions , in Asian countries , but the burden of individual dermatoses in Asia varies by country and socioeconomic status . DALYs means disability-adjusted life years can potentially serve as a purposeful measure for directing resources to improve the burden of skin disease in Asia .\n",
        "Numerous population-based studies have focused on the global prevalence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , but there are few studies on the global trends of the burden associated with AD means atopic dermatitis . We analyzed the global AD means atopic dermatitis trends in 2017 in 195 countries worldwide using the Global Burden of Disease ( GBD means Global Burden of Disease ) Study database , including prevalence rates , age and sex patterns , and AD means atopic dermatitis burden , using disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs means disability-adjusted life years ) . Age-standardized DALYs means disability-adjusted life years were also compared to the sociodemographic index values of all the countries in 2017 . The age-specific DALYs means disability-adjusted life years in 2017 showed a right-skewed distribution , with the highest DALYs means disability-adjusted life years between 1 and 5 years of age . Females had a higher burden of AD means atopic dermatitis throughout all age groups and geographic regions . The GBD means Global Burden of Disease super region with the greatest burden of DALYs means disability-adjusted life years caused by AD means atopic dermatitis was high income ( 178.63 DALYs means disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 males , 231.8 for females ) , and the country with the highest DALYs means disability-adjusted life years was Sweden ( 326.91 ) .

        "Telemedicine provides accurate diagnoses for skin disorders and has gained emphasis . It may be used for the triage and management of common skin diseases in primary care , improving patients ' access and reducing time to treatment . To evaluate the proportion of atopic dermatitis patients who could be managed with the support of telemedicine and its accuracy . Second , we aimed to assess the frequency of atopic dermatitis , demographics , clinical features , and therapies dispensed in relation to the disease . Retrospective study in a population of 30,976 individuals , assisted by telemedicine . We assessed patients with the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and evaluated the proportion of cases referred to biopsy , in-person dermatologists , or to be managed by primary care ; the treatments suggested ; and telemedicine accuracy to diagnose atopic dermatitis . Atopic dermatitis was diagnosed in 1648 patients ( 5.3 % ) , the sixth most common dermatosis , with 2058 lesions ( 3.7 % ) analyzed . Primary care physicians were able to manage 72 % of the atopic dermatitis patients , whereas 28 % of them were referred to in-person dermatologists . Accuracy for atopic dermatitis diagnosis was 84.4 % . Telemedicine was an accurate method and helped primary care physicians to treat 72 % of the atopic dermatitis lesions , thereby optimizing the availability of in-person appointments with dermatologists for more severe cases .\n",
        "Dermatoses contribute to a large burden of global disease , but the relationship between socioeconomic status and the effect of dermatologic conditions in Europe is not well understood . We selected Global Burden of Disease Study data sets to analyze disability-adjusted life-years ( DALYs means disability-adjusted life-years ) and the annual rate of change of dermatoses between 1990 and 2017 in 43 European countries . The principal country-level economic factor used was gross domestic product per capita from the World Bank . Statistical analysis was performed with Spearman ρ correlation . Wealthier European countries had higher DALYs means disability-adjusted life-years for melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , psoriasis , atopic dermatitis , acne , seborrheic dermatitis , alopecia , asthma , contact dermatitis , and viral skin disease . Poorer countries had higher DALYs means disability-adjusted life-years of squamous cell carcinoma , urticaria , decubitus ulcers , pruritus , scabies , tuberculosis , and syphilis . Thirteen European countries were in the top 10th percentile globally for annual increase in skin and subcutaneous disease burden . The majority of European countries have experienced an increase in skin and subcutaneous diseases in recent decades relative to the rest of the world , but the burden of individual dermatoses in Europe varies by country and socioeconomic status . DALYs means disability-adjusted life-years can potentially serve as a purposeful measure for directing resources to improve the burden of skin disease in Europe .\n",

        "Th22 cells constitute a recently described CD4<sup>+</sup > T cell subset defined by its production of interleukin (IL)-22 . The action of IL-22 is mainly restricted to epithelial cells . IL-22 enhances keratinocyte proliferation but inhibits their differentiation and maturation . Dysregulated IL-22 production has been associated to some inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis . How IL-22 production is regulated in human T cells is not fully known . In the present study , we identified conditions to generate Th22 cells that do not co-produce IL-17 from naïve human CD4<sup>+</sup > T cells .

        "The human organism is inhabited by very diverse microorganisms , which constitute the so-called human microbiome and are necessary for the proper functioning of the macroorganism . The correct microbiome ensures homeostasis of the body . A disturbance in its homeostasis leads to dysbiosis . Such deviations may also be related to the development of inflammatory skin diseases , including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis . This review aims to analyse the most current published data on the microbiome of the human skin and examine its role in cutaneous skin diseases , such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis . This review was compiled by collaborating dermatologists specializing in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis . A comprehensive review of current literature was done using PubMed and limited to relevant case reports and original papers on the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis and/or psoriasis . It has not been yet established whether changes in the microbiome are the cause or consequence of disease ( atopic dermatitis/psoriasis ) . However , it was found that in the cases where pathological microflora predominated , an intensification of lesion severity is observed , while with clinical improvement , commensal microflora is restored . Modification of the composition of the microflora may lead to changes in the activation of the immune system and eventually to the development of inflammatory diseases . Adverse effects on the microbiome may include antibiotics , poor diet , stress and adverse environmental conditions . However , more research is needed to identify exact details and mechanisms .\n",
        "Sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT means Sublingual immunotherapy ) has been shown to be efficacious in patients with airway allergic diseases . However , less data have been demonstrated to show the efficacy of SLIT means Sublingual immunotherapy in patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . This study is to evaluate , in a randomized controlled study , the effect of SLIT means Sublingual immunotherapy with house dust mite ( HDM means house dust mite ) in patients with mild-moderate AD means atopic dermatitis . AD means atopic dermatitis patients aged 4 to 60 years with a Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD means Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ) score of 7 - 40 and sensitization to HDM means house dust mite were enrolled in the study . SLIT means Sublingual immunotherapy or control treatment was given for 24 months . SCORAD means Scoring Atopic Dermatitis , visual analog scale ( VAS means visual analog scale ) score were recorded at 6 , 12 , 24 month , and rescue medications were required to be recorded in the diary card . A serum level of specific IgE was tested at 24-month treatment . Ninety-six patients were enrolled , and forty-eight were allocated to SLIT means Sublingual immunotherapy . Thirty-nine patients in the SLIT means Sublingual immunotherapy group and thirty-eight patients in the control group completed the study . The patients in the SLIT means Sublingual immunotherapy group had significantly decreased ΔSCORAD , VAS means visual analog scale and rescue medication score from 12 months ' treatment compared with the control group ( < i > p</i > & lt ; 0.05 ) .

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease . AD means Atopic dermatitis affects 10 - 20 % of children worldwide and persists into adulthood in a minority of cases , affecting approximately 2 - 3 % of the adult population , with an increased prevalence over the past decades in developed countries . Atopy is a genetic tendency to overproduce IgE class antibodies in response to common antigens found in the environment . Concurrence of different atopy such as allergic rhinitis or asthma in children with AD means Atopic dermatitis is estimated at 80 % . AD means Atopic dermatitis is characterized by a vicious cycle of an allergic immune response . The emerging picture of the AD means Atopic dermatitis is a complex disorder with barrier dysfunction , immunological , genetic and environmental factors all playing key roles . Patients with severe or persistent disease and their families experience significant impairment in their quality of life , and in addition , AD means Atopic dermatitis places a heavy economic burden on society as a whole .

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic illness that is associated with immune dysregulation . NK cell function has previously been associated with AD means Atopic dermatitis . NK cells directly interact with polymorphic HLA class I ligand variants using killer cell Ig-like receptors ( KIRs means killer cell Ig-like receptors ) . The purpose of this study was to identify potential associations between NK cell function and AD means Atopic dermatitis by evaluating variation in the presence of KIR genes as well as KIR gene interactions with the appropriate HLA class I KIR-specific ligands . Human DNA from the genetics of AD means Atopic dermatitis case-control study was used to genotype HLA class I KIR-specific ligands and the presence of KIR genes . In the full cohort , an increased risk of AD means Atopic dermatitis was noted for < i > KIR2DL5</i > ( 1.51 [ 1.13 , 2.01 ] ) , < i > KIR2DS5</i > ( 1.72 [ 1.26 , 2.34 ] ) , and < i > KIR</i>2DS1 ( 1.41 [ 1.04 , 1.91 ] ) . Individuals with < i > KIR2DS5</i > or < i > KIR2DS1</i > and the HLA-C*C2 epitope were at an increased risk of AD means Atopic dermatitis ( 1.74 [ 1.21 , 2.51 ] and 1.48 [ 1.04 , 2.12 ] , respectively ) . The HLA-B*-21 T ( TT means The HLA-B*-21T ) leader sequence increased the risk of AD means Atopic dermatitis across ethnicity . African Americans with < i > KIR2DL2</i > , < i > KIR2DS1</i > , < i > KIR2DL5</i > , and < i > KIR2DS5</i > are more likely to have AD means Atopic dermatitis , and the risk increased for < i > KIR2DS1</i > and < i > KIR2DS5</i > in the presence of appropriate HLA-C C2 epitope .

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic , inflammatory skin condition with a multifactorial pathophysiology . The filaggrin gene ( FLG means filaggrin gene ) has particularly been implicated given loss of function ( LoF means loss of function ) mutations in this gene lead to skin barrier dysfunction and such mutations can increase a patient 's likelihood of developing AD means Atopic dermatitis . FLG means filaggrin gene has intragenic copy number variation ( CNV means copy number variation ) , which impacts the total amount of filaggrin produced . Previous research reported a dose-dependent effect such that as amount of FLG means filaggrin gene increases , risk of AD means Atopic dermatitis decreases . To gain a better understanding , we evaluated FLG means filaggrin gene CNV means copy number variation in a large case-control study of Whites and Blacks with and without AD means Atopic dermatitis . The goal of our study was to determine whether FLG means filaggrin gene CNV means copy number variation has a dose-dependent effect on the risk of developing AD means Atopic dermatitis and to determine whether FLG means filaggrin gene CNV means copy number variation varies by race . The frequencies and odds ratios comparing a given CNV means copy number variation by race or race within those with AD means Atopic dermatitis did not significantly vary . It had been thought that FLG means filaggrin gene CNV means copy number variation might vary by race and represent an important association with AD means Atopic dermatitis in Black AD means Atopic dermatitis subjects . However , our work suggests that while there are racial differences with respect to CNV means copy number variation , these differences do not appear to explain AD means Atopic dermatitis risk .\n",

One hallmark of AE means Atopic eczema is a skin barrier disruption on multiple , highly interconnected levels : filaggrin mutations , increased skin pH and a microbiome dysbiosis towards Staphylococcus aureus overgrowth are observed in addition to an abnormal type 2 immune response . Extrinsic factors seem to play a major role in the development of AE means Atopic eczema . As AE means Atopic eczema is a first step in the atopic march , its prevention and appropriate treatment are essential . Although standard therapy remains topical treatment , powerful systemic treatment options emerged in the last years .

Tape-strips captured significant modulation with dupilumab in key AD means atopic dermatitis immune ( eg , C-C motif chemokine ligand 13 [ CCL13 ] , CCL17 , CCL18 ) and barrier ( eg , periplakin , FA2H ) biomarkers . Changes in biomarkers ( CCL20 , interleukin 34 , FABP7 ) were also significantly correlated with clinical disease improvements ( Eczema Area and Severity Index ; R & gt ; 0.5 or R & lt ; -0.4 , P & lt ; 0.05 ) . This real-life study represents the first comprehensive RNA-seq molecular profiling of tape-strips from moderate to severe AD means atopic dermatitis patients after dupilumab therapy . Analysis of tape strip specimens detected significant gene expression changes in key AD means atopic dermatitis biomarkers with dupilumab treatment , suggesting that this approach may be useful to monitor therapeutic responses in inflammatory skin diseases .\n",
        "Primary ( week 16 ) results from the ongoing phase 3 , double-blind AD Up study ( NCT03568318 ) demonstrate a positive benefit-risk profile for upadacitinib+TCS in patients with moderate-to-severe AD . Evaluate efficacy and safety of UPA+TCS through 52 weeks . Patients ( 12 - 75y ) with chronic AD ( ≥10 % of body surface area affected , EASI ≥16 , vIGA-AD ™ ≥3 , and WP-NRS score ≥4 ) were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily upadacitinib 15mg+TCS , upadacitinib 30mg+TCS , or PBO+TCS ( re-randomized at week 16 to upadacitinib+TCS ) . Safety and efficacy , including proportion of patients achieving ≥75 % improvement in EASI ( EASI-75 means efficacy, including proportion of patients achieving ≥75% improvement in EASI ) , vIGA-AD of clear/almost clear with improvement ≥2 grades ( vIGA-AD 0/1 ) , and WP-NRS improvement ≥4 , were assessed through week 52 . Missing data were primarily handled by nonresponder imputation incorporating multiple imputation for missing values due to COVID-19 . Of 901 patients , 300 were randomized to upadacitinib 15mg+TCS , 297 to upadacitinib 30mg+TCS , and 304 to PBO+TCS . For all endpoints , efficacy for upadacitinib 15mg+TCS and upadacitinib 30mg+TCS at week 16 was maintained through week 52 . At week 52 , the proportions of patients treated with upadacitinib 15mg+TCS and upadacitinib 30mg+TCS who achieved EASI-75 means efficacy, including proportion of patients achieving ≥75% improvement in EASI were 50.8 % and 69.0 % , respectively ; 33.5 % and 45.2 % , respectively , achieved vIGA-AD 0/1 ; and 45.3 % and 57.5 % , respectively , achieved WP-NRS improvement ≥4 . upadacitinib+TCS was well tolerated through 52 weeks ; no new important safety risks beyond the current label were observed . No deaths were reported ; events of MACE and VTE were infrequent ( ≤0.2/100 PY ) . Results through 52 weeks demonstrate long-term maintenance of efficacy and a favorable safety profile of upadacitinib+TCS in patients with moderate-to-severe AD .\n",
        "The presence of lesions in visible areas of skin may cause emotional troubles in patients , including low self-worth , embarrassment , sorrow , and social isolation . Those alterations may predispose to psychiatric disorders such as anxiety , depression , and even suicidal ideation , severely affecting patients ' health state and quality of life ( QoL means quality of life ) . In this article , we focus on dermatologic patients that present with secondary mental health alterations . Thus , we offer a detailed description of mental disorders observed in patients with acne vulgaris , atopic dermatitis , psoriasis , ichthyosis , vitiligo , and hidradenitis suppurativa . Moreover , we point out the relationship between the severity of the cutaneous symptoms with mental illnesses and QoL means quality of life decline . Our objective was to highlight the importance of mental health care for patients with skin diseases . The impact of skin alterations on the mental health of dermatological patients should be a central concern . Likewise , the timely identification and treatment of mental disorders are essential for the comprehensive management of these skin diseases .\n",
        "Evidence indicates that age-related macular degeneration ( AMD means age-related macular degeneration ) is associated with the prior presence of allergic diseases ; however , large-scale studies in the literature are limited . A case-control study was conducted to describe the relationship between premorbid allergic diseases and AMD means age-related macular degeneration using Taiwan 's National Health Insurance database . Eligibility criteria for inclusion of new adult AMD means age-related macular degeneration cases from 2000 to 2013 were set up . We defined the year of diagnosis as the index year . Age- , gender- , index year- matched controls who were drawn from the same database . The case control ratio was 1:4 . For all participants , all premorbid conditions staring 1996 to index year were documented . Binary logistic regression was used to describe factors related to AMD means age-related macular degeneration occurrence . The AMD means age-related macular degeneration group consisted of 10,911 patients , and the comparison group consisted of 43,644 individuals . Patients with AMD means age-related macular degeneration showed significant associations with premorbid allergic diseases ( aOR 1.54 , 95 % CI 1.47 - 1.61 ) , specifically with allergic conjunctivitis ( aOR 2.07 , 95 % CI 1.94 - 2.20 ) , allergic rhinitis ( aOR 1.32 , 95 % CI 1.25 - 1.39 ) , asthma ( aOR 0.99 , 95 % CI 0.93 - 1.06 ) , and atopic dermatitis ( aOR 1.04 , 95 % CI 0.94 - 1.17 ) . Further analyses indicated that patients with more concurrent allergic diseases have higher associations with AMD means age-related macular degeneration than those with fewer concurrent diseases . Patients with more annual medical visits for their allergic diseases also showed higher associations with AMD means age-related macular degeneration than those with fewer visits . AMD means age-related macular degeneration is significantly associated with premorbid allergic diseases . The underlying mechanisms must be further investigated .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory disease that may involve any cutaneous site ; involvement of the genital area may greatly impair patients ' quality of life but , as the inspection of genitals is not usually conducted during the routine physical examination of patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , the genital presentation of AD means Atopic dermatitis is frequently neglected and under-reported . We decided to evaluate the incidence of genital AD means Atopic dermatitis in patients with moderate-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis and the relative response to anti-interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 dupilumab . In our study , a high incidence of genital AD means Atopic dermatitis emerged but the use of dupilumab allowed a generalized improvement .\n",
        "Previous studies highlight the need for a more active conditioning therapy in high-risk or refractory and relapsed lymphomas . Our preclinical research shows that histone deacetylase inhibitors , such as either vorinostat or chidamide , sensitize lymphoma cells to the cytotoxic combination of cladribine , gemcitabine and busulfan , leading to cell apoptosis . To evaluate the efficacy of this chidamide-cladribine-gemcitabine-busulfan ( ChiCGB means chidamide-cladribine-gemcitabine-busulfan ) combination as a new conditioning therapy , we conducted a Phase II trial , as described here . Patients with high-risk , relapsed/refractory lymphomas received ChiCGB means chidamide-cladribine-gemcitabine-busulfan as conditioning therapy , after transplantation with autologous peripheral stem cells . The sample comprised 105 patients in total : 60 with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas ( B-NHL means B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas ) and 45 with T-cell or natural killer/T-cell lymphoma ( NK/T means natural killer/T-cell lymphoma ) . All patients eventually achieved full hematopoietic recovery . Neutrophils and platelets were engrafted at a median of 10 days ( 8 - 14 ) and 13 days ( 8 - 38 ) , respectively . There was no transplant-related mortality within 100 days of transplant . Neutropenic fever , mucositis and atopic dermatitis were the observed nonhematologic toxicities . At a median follow-up of 35.4 months , 80.6 % of the patients presented with no tumor progression , and the overall survival ( OS means overall survival ) reached as high as 86.1 % . Concerning the OS means overall survival rate , 94.5 % of patients with B-NHL means B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 75.4 % of patients with T-cell or NK/T means natural killer/T-cell lymphoma lymphomas survived . These findings demonstrate the safety and validity of the proposed combined therapy for high-risk and refractory/relapsed lymphomas .

        "Dupilumab treatment improves signs , symptoms , and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis . This study evaluated the impact of dupilumab treatment on absenteeism , presenteeism , and related costs in a large multi-centre cohort of adult patients with difficult-to-treat atopic dermatitis in daily practice . Patients treated with dupilumab participating in the Dutch BioDay Registry reporting employment were included . Absenteeism , presenteeism , and related costs at baseline and during follow-up were calculated using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire . A total of 218 adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were included . Total work impairment reduced significantly from baseline ( 35.5 % ) to week 52 ( 11.5 % ) , p & lt ; 0.001 .

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common pruritic inflammatory skin disease characterized by impaired epidermal barrier function and dysregulation of Thelper-2 (T < sub > H</sub>2)-biased immune responses . While the lineage of conventional dendritic cells ( cDCs means conventional dendritic cells ) are implicated to play decisive roles in T-cell immune responses , their requirement for the development of AD means Atopic dermatitis remains elusive . Here , we describe the impact of the constitutive loss of cDCs means conventional dendritic cells on the progression of AD-like inflammation by using binary transgenic ( Tg means transgenic ) mice that constitutively lacked CD11c < sup > hi</sup > cDCs means conventional dendritic cells . Unexpectedly , the congenital deficiency of cDCs means conventional dendritic cells not only exacerbates the pathogenesis of AD-like inflammation but also elicits immune abnormalities with the increased composition and function of granulocytes and group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2 ) as well as B cells possibly mediated through the breakdown of the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L)-mediated homeostatic feedback loop . Furthermore , the constitutive loss of cDCs means conventional dendritic cells accelerates skin colonization of < i > Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus)</i > , that associated with disease flare . Thus , cDCs means conventional dendritic cells maintains immune homeostasis to prevent the occurrence of immune abnormalities to maintain the functional skin barrier for mitigating AD means Atopic dermatitis flare .\n",
        "Janus kinase ( JAK means Janus kinase ) inhibitors are novel treatment approaches for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . This study was aimed to compare the efficacy of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors for AD means atopic dermatitis treatment . The database of PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Library were searched until March 28 , 2021 , for randomized control trials ( RCTs means randomized control trials ) of AD means atopic dermatitis patients treated with JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors . Baseline and follow-up data were extracted . Efficacy of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors was evaluated using 50 % improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI-50 means evaluated using 50% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index ) . A Bayesian multiple treatment network meta-analysis with fixed effects was performed . Odds ratio ( OR means Odds ratio ) with 95 % credibility interval ( CrI means credibility interval ) were used for comparing the efficacy of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors with placebo for AD means atopic dermatitis . A total of seven RCTs means randomized control trials of JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors with 2530 patients were included for analysis . After excluded one study with high risk of bias , a total of six JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors with 17 different formulations and doses were analyzed . The severity of atopic dermatitis of included patients was almost moderate to severe ( 93.4 % ) . Compared with placebo , all JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors had higher EASI-50 means evaluated using 50% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index at 4 weeks of treatment , except for baricitinib with 1 mg once daily ( QD ) ( OR means Odds ratio : 1.4 , 95 % Crl : 0.9 - 2.1 ) , ruxolitinib with 0.15 % QD ( OR means Odds ratio : 2.3 , 95 % Crl : 0.8 - 11.4 ) , and ruxolitinib with 0.5 % QD ( OR means Odds ratio : 3.4 , 95 % Crl : 0.9 - 18.1 ) . Among all included , upadacitinib had the highest probability of being the best treatment ( SUCRA value of 0.936 ) . In topical JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors , delgocitinib 3 % twice a day ( BID ) had the highest probability of being the best treatment ( SUCRA value of 0.849 ) . JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors had promising treatment efficacy for AD means atopic dermatitis patients .

        "The clinical significance and regulators of IL-13Rα2 in itch and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) remain unclear . To identify disease-driven regulatory circuits of IL-13Rα2 , transcriptomic/pathological analysis was performed in skin from patients with AD means atopic dermatitis , psoriasis , healthy subjects , and murine AD means atopic dermatitis model . Functionality was investigated in sensory neurons , keratinocytes and animal model , by using knockdown ( KD means knockdown ) , calcium imaging , RNA-seq , cytokine arrays , pharmacological assays , and behavioural investigations . In our study , an upregulated IL-13Rα2 expression was revealed in skin of AD means atopic dermatitis patients , but not psoriasis , in a disease activity-dependent manner . In cultured human keratinocytes , IL-13 increased IL-13Rα2 transcription levels , and this were downregulated by IL-13Rα1KD . IL-13Rα2KD reduced transcription levels of EDNRA , CCL20 , CCL26 . In contrast , sensory neuron-derived IL-13Rα2 was upregulated by TLR2 heterodimer agonists , Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1 . In a mouse cheek model , pre-administration of Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1 enhanced IL-13-elicited scratching behaviour . Consistently , in cultured sensory neurons Pam3CSK4 enhanced IL-13-elicted calcium transients , increased number of responders , and orchestrated chemerin , CCL17 and CCL22 release . These release was inhibited by IL-13Rα2KD . Collectively , IL-13 regulates keratinocyte-derived IL-13Rα2 and TLR2 to modulate neuronal IL-13Rα2 , thereby promoting neurogenic inflammation and exacerbating AD means atopic dermatitis and itch . Thus , the cutaneous IL-13-IL-13Rα2 and neuronal TLR2-IL-13Rα2 pathway represent important targets to treat AD means atopic dermatitis and itch .\n",
        "The topical calcineurin inhibitors ( TCIs means topical calcineurin inhibitors ) tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have been used widely as corticosteroid-sparing agents in treating various cutaneous diseases . However , the association between TCIs means topical calcineurin inhibitors and risk of malignancy remains controversial . By systematic review and meta-analysis , we aimed to investigate the association between TCIs means topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma . Eligible studies in online databases were identified from the date of inception to August 30 , 2020 . To assess the outcome of TCI-related risk of lymphoma , analysis of cohort studies comparing the incidence of lymphoma with and without treatment with TCIs means topical calcineurin inhibitors was performed . Furthermore , the subgroup analyses of Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were also conducted . The pooled results revealed that using topical tacrolimus ( RR 1.68 , 95 % CI 1.39 - 2.04 ) or pimecrolimus ( RR 1.40 , 95 % CI 1.13 - 1.74 ) significantly increased the risk of lymphoma . TCI users also showed higher incidence of lymphoma in the range of 0.02 - 0.09 % , compared to that of 0.02 - 0.06 % in the control group . Additionally , subgroup analyses showed both tacrolimus ( RR 1.89 ; 95 % CI 1.53 - 2.32 ) and pimecrolimus ( RR 1.38 ; 95 % CI 1.09 - 1.74 ) had significantly higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , but no increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma . In conclusion , TCI-exposed patients have a significantly increased risk of lymphoma , especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions and intense pruritus , and it can have marked negative impact on those affected . Pathophysiologically , AD means Atopic dermatitis is complex with genetic predisposition and environmental provocation being important contributors . Mechanistically these can promote epidermal barrier dysfunction , skin microbiome abnormalities and a skewed immune response which is predominantly type-2 immunity-based . Our increased understanding of the immunological processes involved highlight a key role for interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) . This mini-review evaluates tralokinumab , a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits IL-13 . Based on dose-finding study results , tralokinumab 300 mg every two weeks ( Q2W ) subcutaneously ( SC means subcutaneously ) was investigated in three pivotal phase III clinical trials in adults with moderate-to-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled on topical corticosteroids alone . Tralokinumab was significantly superior to placebo regarding the proportion of patients achieving IGA 0/1 and EASI-75 at week 16 ( primary endpoints ) , as well as improving scores for worst daily pruritus , Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index ) , and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD means Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ) ( secondary endpoints ) . The week 16 response was sustained during follow-up , and treatment with tralokinumab was found to be well-tolerated with an overall frequency and severity of adverse events comparable to placebo .\n",
        "Conjunctivitis in atopic dogs has already been described yet is rarely observed , and likely underdiagnosed in practice . To assay various cytokines in tears and conjunctivae from atopic and normal dogs , and to compare canine atopic dermatitis-associated conjunctivitis with controls . Ten atopic and ten normal client-owned dogs . Ocular surfaces were sampled bilaterally in a prospective study , using two different methods . Tear samples were obtained with a sterile swab previously moistened with saline solution ( method A ) . Conjunctival impressions were obtained with a conjunctival impression device ( method B ) . For each sample , the concentrations of a panel of 13 cytokines were measured by multiplex analyses . CADESI-4 , pruritus ( PS means pruritus ) and conjunctival ( CS means CADESI-4、掻痒(PS) および結膜 ) scores were determined . Among the measured cytokines , only granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) , keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC)-like and interleukin (IL)-8 were above the limit of quantification in most samples . Absolute amounts of each cytokine were always higher in samples obtained with method A than with method B. GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor amounts were lower in atopic dogs ( method A , P=0.02 ; method B , P=0.0005 ) . KC levels were higher in atopic dogs , yet the differences were not significant . IL-8 amounts were higher in atopic dogs ( method A , P=0.0003 ; method B , P=0.006 ) . Regardless of the method , these preliminary results suggest an overexpression of IL-8 in conjunctivae and tears of atopic dogs despite subtle conjunctival symptoms . As IL-8 is commonly found in many inflammatory conditions , further studies are needed to determine its specificity in atopic conjunctivitis .

Des impressions de conjonctive ont été obtenues par impression conjonctivale ( méthode B ) . Pour chaque échantillon , les concentrations d’un panel de 13 cytokines ont été mesurées par analyses multiplexes . Le CADESI-04 , les scores de prurit ( PS means pruritus ) et de conjonctive ( CS means CADESI-4、掻痒(PS) および結膜 ) ont été évalués . RÉSULTATS : Parmi les cytokines mesurées , seules GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) , KC ( keratinocyte-derived chemokine)-like et interleukine (IL)-8 étaient au dessus des limites de quantification de la plu spart des échantillons . Les quantités absolues de chaque cytokine étaient toujours plus élevées dans les échantillons obtenus par la méthode A que par la méthode B. Les quantités de GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor étaient plus faibles chez les chiens atopiques bien que la différence ne soit pas significative . Les quantités d’IL-8 étaient plus élevées chez les chiens atopiques ( méthode A , P=0.0003 ; méthode B , P=0.006 ) . Sans parler de la méthode , ces résultats préliminaires suggèrent une surexpression d’IL-8 dans la conjonctive et les larmes des chiens atopiques malgré les subtils symptômes conjonctivaux .

INTRODUCCIÓN : la conjuntivitis en perros atópicos ya ha sido descrita , pero aun así rara vez se observa y probablemente se infradiagnostica en la práctica OBJETIVOS : analizar varias citoquinas en lágrimas y conjuntivas de perros atópicos y normales , y comparar la conjuntivitis asociada a dermatitis atópica canina con controles . ANIMALES : diez perros atópicos y diez perros normales de propietarios particulares . MÉTODOS Y MATERIALES : se tomaron muestras de forma bilateral de las superficies oculares en un estudio prospectivo , utilizando dos métodos diferentes . Las muestras de lágrimas se obtuvieron con un hisopo estéril previamente humedecido con solución salina ( método A ) . Las impresiones conjuntivales se obtuvieron con un dispositivo de impresión conjuntival ( método B ) . Para cada muestra , se midieron las concentraciones de un panel de 13 citoquinas mediante análisis multiplex . Se determinaron las puntuaciones CADESI-4 , prurito ( PS means pruritus ) y conjuntival ( CS means CADESI-4、掻痒(PS) および結膜 ) . RESULTADOS : entre las citoquinas valoradas , solo el factor estimulante de colonias de granulocitos y macrófagos ( GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) , quimioquinas similares a las derivadas de queratinocitos ( KC ) e interleuquina ( IL means interleuquina ) -8 estuvieron por encima del límite de cuantificación en la mayoría de las muestras . Las cantidades absolutas de cada citoquina fueron siempre mayores en las muestras obtenidas con el método A que con el método B. Las cantidades de GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor fueron menores en perros atópicos ( método A , P = 0,02 ; método B , P = 0,0005 ) . Los niveles de KC fueron más altos en los perros atópicos , pero las diferencias no fueron significativas . Las cantidades de IL-8 fueron mayores en perros atópicos ( método A , P = 0,0003 ; método B , P = 0,006 ) . CONCLUSIONES Y RELEVANCIA CLÍNICA : Independientemente del método , estos resultados preliminares sugieren una sobreexpresión de IL-8 en conjuntivas y lágrimas de perros atópicos a pesar de signos clínicos conjuntivales sutiles . Como la IL-8 se encuentra comúnmente en muchas afecciones inflamatorias , se necesitan más estudios para determinar su especificidad en la conjuntivitis atópica . Eine Konjunktivitis bei atopischen Hunden wurde bereits beschrieben , wird aber selten beobachtet und es besteht die Vermutung , dass sie in der Praxis selten diagnostiziert wird . Verschiedene Zytokine sollten in Tränen und in der Konjunktiva mittels Assays bei atopischen und normalen Hunden untersucht werden und ein Vergleich der Konjunktivitis i m Zusammenhang mit caniner atopischer Dermatitis und Kontrolltieren durchgeführt werden . Zehn atopische und zehn normale Hunde in Privatbesitz . Es wurden bilateral von okulären Oberflächen Proben für eine prospektive Studie entnommen , wobei zwei Methoden zum Einsatz kamen . Es wurden Tränenproben mit sterilen Tupfern , die zuvor mit einer Kochsalzlösung befeuchtet worden waren , genommen ( Methode A ) . Außerdem wurden Impressionen der Bindehaut mit einem konjunktivalen Impressionsgerät ( Methode B ) genommen . Für jede Probe wurden die Konzentrationen eines Panels von 13 Zytokinen mittels Multiplex Analyse gemessen . CADESI-4 , Pruritus ( PS means pruritus ) und Konjunktiva Auswertungen ( CS means CADESI-4、掻痒(PS) および結膜 ) wurden festgehalten . Von den gemessenen Zytokinen lagen bei den meisten Proben nur der Granulozyten-Makrophagen Kolonie-stimulierende Faktor ( GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) , der Keratinozyten-derived Chemokine (KC)-like Faktor und Interleukin (IL)-8 über der Messgrenze . Absolutwerte eines jeden Zytokins lagen in Proben , die mit Methode A gewonnen worden waren , immer höher als bei jenen , die mit Methode B gewonnen worden waren . GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor Werte waren bei atopischen Hunden niedriger ( Methode A , P = 0,02 ; Methode B , P = 0,0005 ) . KC Werte waren bei atopischen Hunden höher , aber die Unterschiede waren nicht signifikant . IL-8 Werte waren bei atopischen Hunden höher ( Methode A , P = 0,0003 ; Methode B , P = 0,006 ) . Diese vorläufigen Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin - egal welche Methode angewendet wurde - dass trotz geringer konjunktivaler Symptome eine Überexprimierung von IL-8 in Konjunktiva und Tränen von atopischen Hunden vorkommt . Da IL-8 häufig bei entzündlichen Erkrankungen auftritt , sind weitere Studien nötig , um seine Spezifität bei der atopischen Konjunktivitis zu bestimmen . 背景 : アトピー犬に発症する結膜炎はすでに説明されているが、実際にはほとんど観察されず、おそらく過小診断されている 。 目的 : 本研究の目的は、アトピーおよび健常犬の涙液および結膜のさまざまなサイトカインを解析し、犬アトピー性皮膚炎に関連する結膜炎を対照と比較することであった 。 被験動物 : 10頭のアトピー犬および10頭のオーナー所有の健常犬 。 材料と方法 : 前向き研究では、2つの異なる方法を用いて、両眼の表面からサンプリングした。涙液サンプルは、あらかじめ生理食塩水で湿らせた滅菌綿棒で採取した ( 方法A ) 。 結膜インプレッションは、結膜インプレッション装置 ( 方法B ) で得られた。各サンプルについて、13種類のサイトカインパネル濃度を多重分析によって測定した 。 CADESI-4、掻痒(PS ) および結膜 ( CS means CADESI-4、掻痒(PS) および結膜 ) スコアを測定した 。 結果 : 測定されたサイトカインのうち、顆粒球マクロファージコロニー刺激因子 ( GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) 、 ケラチノサイト由来ケモカイン ( KC ) 様、およびインターロイキン (IL)-8のみが、ほとんどのサンプルで定量限界を超えていた。各サイトカインの絶対量は、方法Bよりも方法Aで得られたサンプルで常に高かった。GM-CSF量はアトピー犬で低かった ( 方法A、P = 0.02;方法B、P = 0.0005 ) 。 KCレベルはアトピー犬の方が高かったが、その差は有意ではなかった 。 IL-8量は、アトピー犬の方が高かった ( 方法A、P = 0.0003;方法B、P = 0.006 ) 。 結論と臨床的関連性 : 方法に関係なく、これらの予備的な結果は、微妙な結膜症状にもかかわらず、結膜およびアトピー犬の涙液におけるIL-8の過剰発現を示唆している 。 IL-8は多くの炎症状態で一般的に見られるため、アトピー性結膜炎におけるその特異性を決定するには、さらなる研究が必要である 。 . 背景 : 已经描述了特应性犬中的结膜炎 , 但在临床中很少观察到 , 并且可能诊断不足 。 目的 测定特应性和正常犬泪液和结膜中的各种细胞因子 , 并将犬特应性皮炎相关结膜炎与对照组进行比较 。 动物 10只特应性和10只正常客户拥有的犬 。 方法和材料 : 在一项前瞻性研究中 , 使用两种不同的方法对眼表进行双侧采样。用预先用生理盐水溶液润湿的无菌拭子获得泪液样本 ( 方法a ) 。 用结膜按压工具获得结膜压片 ( 方法B ) 。 对于每份样本 , 通过多重分析测量一组13种细胞因子的浓度。测定CADESI-4、瘙痒(PS)和结膜(CS)评分 。 结果 : 在测量的细胞因子中 , 只有粒细胞-巨噬细胞集落刺激因子(GM-CSF)、角质形成细胞衍生趋化因子(KC)样和白介素(IL)-8在大多数样本中高于定量限。用方法A获得的样本中 , 每种细胞因子的绝对量始终高于方法B。特应性犬中GM-CSF的量较低 ( 方法A , P = 0.02 ; 方法B , P = 0.0005 ) 。 特应性犬的KC水平较高 , 但差异不显著。特应性犬的IL-8量较高 ( 方法A , P = 0.0003 ; 方法B , P = 0.006 ) 。 结论和临床相关性 : 无论采用何种方法 , 这些初步结果表明尽管存在细微的结膜症状 , 但特应性犬的结膜和泪液中IL-8过度表达。由于IL-8常见于许多炎性疾病 , 因此需要进一步的研究来确定其在特应性结膜炎中的特异性 。 .

Foram determinados os escores CADESI-4 , prurido ( PS means pruritus ) e conjuntival ( CS means CADESI-4、掻痒(PS) および結膜 ) . Entre as citocinas medidas , apenas o fator estimulador de colônias de granulócitos-macrófagos ( GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) , quimiocinas derivadas de queratinócitos ( KC ) e interleucina ( IL means interleuquina ) -8 estavam acima do limite de quantificação na maioria das amostras . As quantidades absolutas de cada citocina foram sempre maiores nas amostras obtidas com o método A do que com o método B. As quantidades de GM-CSF means granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor foram menores em cães atópicos ( método A , P = 0,02 ; método B , P = 0,0005 ) . Os níveis de KC foram maiores em cães atópicos , mas as diferenças não foram significativas . As quantidades de IL-8 foram maiores em cães atópicos ( método A , P = 0,0003 ; método B , P = 0,006 ) . CONCLUSÕES E RELEVÂNCIA CLÍNICA : Independentemente do método , esses resultados preliminares sugerem uma superexpressão de IL-8 na conjuntiva e lágrimas de cães atópicos , apesar dos sintomas conjuntivais sutis . Como a IL-8 é comumente encontrada em muitas condições inflamatórias , mais estudos são necessários para determinar sua especificidade na conjuntivite atópica .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a common , complex skin disorder with significant morbidity . The management of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and often varies by physician experience and comfort level . We conducted a single-institution survey of pediatric emergency medicine physicians regarding their perceived confidence in managing atopic dermatitis , knowledge of treatment options , and interest in patient-centered clinical resources . The results of our survey suggest that many pediatric emergency physicians at our center are somewhat confident managing atopic dermatitis and that topical corticosteroids represent the mainstay of treatment of AD . Our survey identified common AD therapies used by emergency department physicians and highlights the desire for further patient-centered resources in the emergency care setting .\n",
        "Microbiota composition and associated metabolic activities are essential for the education and development of a healthy immune system . Microbial dysbiosis , caused by risk factors such as diet , birth mode , or early infant antimicrobial therapy , is associated with the inception of allergic diseases . In turn , allergic diseases increase the risk for irrational use of antimicrobial therapy . Microbial therapies , such as probiotics , have been studied in the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases , but evidence remains limited due to studies with high heterogeneity , strain-dependent effectiveness , and variable outcome measures . In this review , we sketch the relation of microbiota with allergic diseases , the overuse and rationale for the use of antimicrobial agents in allergic diseases , and current knowledge concerning the use of bacterial products in allergic diseases . We urgently recommend 1 ) limiting antibiotic therapy in pregnancy and early childhood as a method contributing to the reduction of the allergy epidemic in children and 2 ) restricting antibiotic therapy in exacerbations and chronic treatment of allergic diseases , mainly concerning asthma and atopic dermatitis . Future research should be aimed at antibiotic stewardship implementation strategies and biomarker-guided therapy , discerning those patients that might benefit from antibiotic therapy .\n",
        "Type 2 immunity and inflammation underlie allergic skin disorders , such as atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . In type 2 inflammation , IL-4 , IL-13 , and IL-5 , which are signature type 2 cytokines , are mainly produced by type 2 helper T ( Th2 ) cells and form the characteristic features of AD means atopic dermatitis . Epithelial cell-derived cytokines such as IL-25 , IL-33 , and TSLP initiate type 2 inflammation by modulating various cells , including group 2 innate lymphoid cells . Moreover , IL-31 , a newly identified type 2 cytokine produced mainly by Th2 cells , induces pruritus by acting on sensory neurons in the skin . Based on both basic and clinical findings , several biologics targeting Th2 cytokines have been developed and exhibited significant efficacy as therapeutic reagents for AD means atopic dermatitis . We have summarized the roles of each cytokine ( IL-4 , 5 , 13 , 25 , 31 , and 33 , and TSLP ) in the development of type 2 inflammation , especially AD means atopic dermatitis , from the view of basic studies in mice and clinical trials/observation in humans .\n",
        "There is a paucity of data concerning the usability of trichoscopy in erythrodermic patients . The objective of the study was to compare trichoscopic features in erythroderma of various etiologies . Forty-nine patients with the determined cause of erythroderma ( including atopic dermatitis , mycosis fungoides , allergic contact eczema , psoriasis , Sézary syndrome , drug reactions , pityriasis rubra pilaris , dermatomyositis , actinic reticuloid , crusted scabies and pemphigus foliaceus ) were included in the study . Dotted vessels were present in patients with atopic dermatitis , pityriasis rubra pilaris , mycosis fungoides , Sézary syndrome and psoriasis and absent in dermatomyositis , crusted scabies , and pemphigus foliaceus ( chi-square test , p=0.016 ) . Spermatozoon-like vessels were observed only in mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome ( p=0.001 ) . Whitish-pinkish structureless areas were described in all patients with mycosis fungoides , pemphigus foliaceus , actinic reticuloid , and crusted scabies ( p=0.028 ) . The type of vessels and the presence of whitish-pinkish structureless areas under trichoscopy may indicate the cause of erythroderma .\n",
        "The two most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases are atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and psoriasis . The underpinnings of the remarkable degree of clinical heterogeneity of AD means atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are poorly understood and , as a consequence , disease onset and progression are unpredictable and the optimal type and time point for intervention are as yet unknown . The BIOMAP project is the first IMI ( Innovative Medicines Initiative ) project dedicated to investigating the causes and mechanisms of AD means atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and to identify potential biomarkers responsible for the variation in disease outcome . The consortium includes 7 large pharmaceutical companies and 25 non-industry partners including academia . Since there is mounting evidence supporting an important role for microbial exposures and our microbiota as factors mediating immune polarization and AD means atopic dermatitis and psoriasis pathogenesis , an entire work package is dedicated to the investigation of skin and gut microbiome linked to AD means atopic dermatitis or psoriasis . The large collaborative BIOMAP project will enable the integration of patient cohorts , data and knowledge in unprecedented proportions . The project has a unique opportunity with a potential to bridge and fill the gaps between current problems and solutions . This review highlights the power and potential of the BIOMAP project in the investigation of microbe-host interplay in AD means atopic dermatitis and psoriasis .\n",
        "Molecular forms of allergen-specific immunotherapy ( AIT means allergen-specific immunotherapy ) are continuously emerging to improve the efficacy of the treatment , to shorten the duration of protocols and to prevent any side effects . The present review covers the recent progress in the development of AIT means allergen-specific immunotherapy based on nucleic acid encoding allergens or CpG oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG-ODN means CpG oligodeoxynucleotides ) . Therapeutic vaccinations with plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA means deoxyribonucleic acid ) encoding major shrimp Met e 1 or insect For t 2 allergen were effective for the treatment of food or insect bite allergy in respective animal models . DNA means deoxyribonucleic acid expressing hypoallergenic shrimp tropomyosin activated Foxp3 + T regulatory ( Treg means T regulatory ) cells whereas DNA means deoxyribonucleic acid encoding For t 2 down-regulated the expression of pruritus-inducing IL-31 . Co-administrations of major cat allergen Fel d 1 with high doses of CpG-ODN means CpG oligodeoxynucleotides reduced Th2 airway inflammation through tolerance induction mediated by GATA3 + Foxp3hi Treg means T regulatory cells as well as early anti-inflammatory TNF/TNFR2 signaling cascade . Non-canonical CpG-ODN means CpG oligodeoxynucleotides derived from Cryptococcus neoformans as well as methylated CpG sites present in the genomic DNA means deoxyribonucleic acid from Bifidobacterium infantis mediated Th1 or Treg means T regulatory cell differentiation respectively . Recent studies on plasmid DNA means deoxyribonucleic acid encoding allergens evidenced their therapeutic potential for the treatment of food allergy and atopic dermatitis . Unmethylated or methylated CpG-ODNs were shown to activate dose-dependent Treg/Th1 responses . Large clinical trials need to be conducted to confirm these promising preclinical data . Moreover , tremendous success of messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA means messenger ribonucleic acid ) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 must encourage as well the re-exploration of mRNA means messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine platform for innovative AIT means allergen-specific immunotherapy .\n",
        "The purpose of this review is to highlight and compare the structural and functional differences between the ocular surface and the skin . The goal is to further understand how these components interact from an immunobiological standpoint , which may inform future therapeutic uses . Treatment agents , such as Dupilumab and Apremilast are traditionally indicated for integumentary conditions , such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis , respectively . Both were also found to have potent effects on the conjunctival surface and ocular glands , which may be attributed to the similarities in structure . Surfaces of the eyes and the skin are found to have similar composition in terms of immunohistology , steroidogenic properties , and allergic mechanisms . These translate directly into both the adverse effects and therapeutic benefits that overlap when treating these surfaces .\n",
        "Various atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) phenotypes showed an enormously heterogenic risk for subsequent asthma development . We aimed to investigate the association between AD means atopic dermatitis phenotypes and the risk for progression to asthma . We searched PubMed , Embase , and Web of Science databases for relevant publications . Pooled relative risks ( RR means relative risks ) with 95 % CI were calculated using the CMA-3.0 software . This study has been registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42019129273 ) . We analyzed 39 publications with 458,810 participants . The RR means relative risks for asthma in AD means atopic dermatitis was 2.16 ( 95 % CI , 1.88 - 2.48 ) . The risk in persistent AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR means relative risks , 3.36 ; 95 % CI , 2.83 - 3.99 ) was higher than in transient AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR means relative risks , 1.52 ; 95 % CI , 1.34 - 1.73 ) , and the risk in severe AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR means relative risks , 2.40 ; 95 % CI , 1.96 - 2.94 ) was higher than in mild AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR means relative risks , 1.82 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 3.23 ) or moderate AD means atopic dermatitis ( RR means relative risks , 1.51 ; 95 % CI , 1.30 - 1.75 ) . The risk for asthma in early-onset AD means atopic dermatitis was slightly higher than in late-onset AD means atopic dermatitis and higher in boys than in girls . The AD means atopic dermatitis and asthma definitions differed across the included studies . Patients with persistent or severe AD means atopic dermatitis were at a higher risk for developing asthma . These findings further elucidate the atopic march and identify target populations for asthma prevention .\n",

        "The skin is the largest organ in the human body , and it orchestrates many functions that are fundamentally important for our survival . Although the skin might appear to present a relatively inhospitable or even hostile environment , a multitude of commensals and also some potentially pathogenic microorganisms have successfully adapted to survive and/or thrive within the diverse ecological niches created by the skin 's topographical architecture . Dysbiosis within these microbial populations can result in the emergence and pathological progression of skin diseases . Unsurprisingly , this has led to a new focus of research both for the medical dermatology and cosmetic industries that is concerned with modulation of the skin microbiome to help address common microbially mediated or modulated conditions such as acne , body odour , and atopic dermatitis . This review presents an overview of our current understanding of the complex relationship of the skin with its microbiome and then introduces the concept of probiotic intervention for the management of microbial dysbiosis within the skin ecosystem .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by unrelenting pruritus and recurrent eczematous lesions . It affects up to 15 % of children and adolescents and up to 5 % of adults , and confers a high and multifactorial burden to patients , families and society . With increasing awareness of this substantial burden , AD means Atopic dermatitis has become a priority for healthcare systems . The Atopic Dermatitis Quality of Care ( ADQoC means Atopic Dermatitis Quality of Care ) initiative set out to describe good practices for addressing the challenges that impede the management of AD means Atopic dermatitis . The initiative carried out a literature review and surveyed 32 expert care centres , catalogued findings , and analysed and elucidated global challenges to AD means Atopic dermatitis care along with good practice implementations that can address them . The four challenges to quality care for AD means Atopic dermatitis are : ( i ) misconceptions about AD means Atopic dermatitis ; ( ii ) delayed referral and access to AD means Atopic dermatitis specialists ; ( iii ) poor patient access to AD means Atopic dermatitis treatments and poor adherence to medications ; and ( iv ) managing the complexity of AD means Atopic dermatitis and its comorbidities . The initiative highlighted 5 of 10 good practice implementations as high priority for any AD means Atopic dermatitis care centre to focus on : ( i ) clinical assessment and diagnosis ; ( ii ) a structured multidisciplinary care team ; ( iii ) monitoring and evaluating care quality ; ( iv ) patient education and communication ; and ( v ) collaboration and exchange with patient groups . These implementations can provide benefits for patients , healthcare providers and the healthcare system . They directly contribute to the efficacy of treatment , improved healthcare provider efficiency , improved education for patients and healthcare providers , and improved costs to healthcare systems .

        "Pigmented transverse nasal band/groove is an asymptomatic benign condition , characterized by the development of erythematous to hyperpigmented , well-demarcated , transverse groove at the junction of middle and lower two-third of the nasal dorsum . Although the pathogenesis is unclear , embryologic origin seems to be the most plausible hypothesis . This condition is often associated other related dermatological conditions such as milia , comedones , seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis . Diagnosis is mostly clinical , while reassurance is the mainstay of therapy . In persistent cases , topical retinoids have been used . In this article , we have reviewed the different aspects of this condition including treatment , along with the recent updates to create awareness about this dermatological entity .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a common , chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease , which often appears in childhood but can last into adulthood . It negatively impacts patients , their families and society in general . There is a therapeutic unmet need , with patients requiring new drugs that are safe and effective . The increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of AD and the role of the Janus kinase ( JAK means Janus kinase ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT means signal transducer and activator of transcription ) pathway in the development and maintenance of AD , has led to the development of agents blocking this intracellular signaling pathway , the JAK means Janus kinase inhibitors . Baricitinib shows high selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2 , making it appealing for the treatment of this condition . Phase II and phase III trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in the treatment of AD , and the results have been encouraging , showing a good efficacy and a favorable safety and tolerability profile . At the end of 2020 , EMA approved baricitinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy , increasing the therapeutic option for this debilitating disease .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease often requiring long-term treatment . Crisaborole significantly improved global AD means Atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms in 28-day phase 3 studies of patients aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD means Atopic dermatitis ( Investigator 's Static Global Assessment [ ISGA ] 2 or 3 ) . A post hoc analysis of a long-term , open-label extension study was conducted to assess efficacy and safety trends of crisaborole in patients stratified by the number of initial consecutive crisaborole treatment cycles , defined as the number of treatment cycles completed before achievement of ISGA 0 (clear)/1 ( almost clear ) . Patients completing phase 3 studies without drug-related safety issues that precluded further crisaborole treatment were analyzed . Patients with ISGA 0/1 at baseline ( the end of a 28-day cycle ) did not receive crisaborole for the next 28-day cycle ( off-treatment ) , whereas patients with ISGA ≥ 2 received crisaborole for the next 28-day cycle ( on-treatment ) . Patients were stratified by number of initial consecutive crisaborole treatment cycles . Efficacy was assessed by achievement and maintenance of ISGA 0/1 , and safety was assessed by incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs means treatment-emergent adverse events ) and treatment-related AEs ( TRAEs means treatment-related AEs ) . Overall , 418 patients were included in exclusive cohorts based on number of consecutive on-treatment cycles ( 1 on-treatment cycle , n = 133 ; 2 consecutive on-treatment cycles , n = 106 ; 3 consecutive on-treatment cycles , n = 106 ; 4 consecutive on-treatment cycles , n = 73 ) . After one to four initial consecutive on-treatment cycles , 77.6 , 76.3 , 59.4 , and 43.1 % of patients , respectively , achieved ISGA 0/1 . Of these patients , 49.5 , 37.8 , 44.4 , and 45.2 % , respectively , maintained ISGA 0/1 at the end of a 28-day cycle off-treatment . Incidence of TRAEs means treatment-related AEs was 4.5 , 4.7 , 3.8 , and 1.4 % for patients receiving one to four consecutive on-treatment cycles , respectively . One patient discontinued because of AEs . These results support the efficacious and safe continuous , long-term use of crisaborole for the management of mild-to-moderate AD means Atopic dermatitis . ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT02118766 , NCT02118792 . Eczema is a skin disease that often requires long-term treatment . Crisaborole ointment improved mild-to-moderate eczema after 28 days of continuous use in two phase 3 clinical trials that included patients aged ≥ 2 years . In the study reported here we tested whether eczema improved with continuous crisaborole use after one to four back-to-back treatment periods , or 28–112 days . Patients who completed either of the aforementioned phase 3 clinical trials were included in this study . Patients received crisaborole for the next 28-day period if they had eczema rashes . Patients with clear or almost clear skin did not receive crisaborole for 28 days . Our study included a total of 418 patients . After one to four treatment periods , 78 , 76 , 59 , and 43 % of patients , respectively , had clear or almost clear skin . Of these patients , 50 , 38 , 44 , and 45 % still had clear or almost clear skin after stopping treatment for 28 days . Fewer than one in 20 patients had side effects related to crisaborole after one to four treatment periods . The most common side effect at the application site that was related to crisaborole was pain , particularly stinging and burning . Up to one in 50 patients had application site pain . One patient stopped taking crisaborole because of side effects . In conclusion , these results suggest that long-term crisaborole use is effective and safe .\n",

        "Pruritus is the most burdensome and prevalent symptom in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis . Treating atopic itch has historically been a challenge due to multiple underlying mechanisms within its pathogenesis and an incomplete understanding of them . In recent years , our understanding of these mechanisms have increased tremendously and subsequently , new treatments have reached the market that target the pathophysiology of atopic itch from different angles . In addition , there are several promising new treatments currently in development and trials . In the current article , we discuss these currently available treatment options , their available evidence and efficacy , and highlight some of the more recent advancements in the field .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic , inflammatory condition causing a substantial burden to patients and caregivers . SHR0302 is an oral , highly selective , Janus kinase 1 inhibitor under investigation for inflammatory skin diseases . The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of SHR0302 in Chinese patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis . A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter , phase II trial was conducted in China between October 2019 and August 2020 . Patients ( n = 105 ) aged 18 - 75 years with moderate to severe dermatitis and nonresponsive or intolerant to topical or conventional systemic treatments were included . Patients were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive SHR0302 4 mg once daily , SHR0302 8 mg once daily , or placebo for 12 weeks . The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment ) response ( IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment of 0 [ clear ] or 1 [ almost clear ] with improvement of ≥2 grades ) at week 12 . Secondary efficacy assessments included Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) and pruritus Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS means Numerical Rating Scale ) scores . At week 12 , IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment response was achieved in nine patients ( 25.7 % ; 90 % confidence interval [ CI ] 13.6 - 37.9 % ; p = 0.022 ) in the SHR0302 4 mg group , 19 patients ( 54.3 % ; 90 % CI 40.4 - 68.1 % ; p & lt ; 0.001 ) in the SHR0302 8 mg group , and two patients ( 5.7 % ; 90 % CI 0.0 - 12.2 % ) in the placebo group .

        "Cold atmospheric plasma ( CAP means Cold atmospheric plasma ) has been incorporated into various fields , including promotion of cutaneous wound healing . Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic cutaneous condition characterized by inflammation-induced skin wounds and impaired skin barrier function . To investigate whether CAP means Cold atmospheric plasma may improve AD means Atopic dermatitis using an animal model . Dermatophagoides farinae extracts (DFE)-induced murine models of AD means Atopic dermatitis were used in this study . The plasma-treated group received a total of 6 CAP means Cold atmospheric plasma treatments during 2 weeks , while the control group did not receive any treatment . Differences in dermatitis severity , transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) , serum level of immunoglobulin ( Ig means immunoglobulin ) E and epidermal thickness were evaluated in both groups . The dermatitis severity was significantly improved by CAP means Cold atmospheric plasma treatment . TEWL means transepidermal water loss was lower in the plasma-treated group compared with the non-treated control group . Serum Ig means immunoglobulin E dropped significantly after treatment with CAP means Cold atmospheric plasma . Difference in epidermal thickness of the ear skin was not significant between the plasma-treated and non-treated groups . Localized treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis with CAP means Cold atmospheric plasma decreases dermatitis severity , TEWL means transepidermal water loss , and serum Ig means immunoglobulin E level . These results show CAP means Cold atmospheric plasma 's potentials as a novel therapeutic modality for AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "We examined the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of asiatic acid means atopic dermatitis (AD ( AA means asiatic acid ) in atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . AA means asiatic acid treatment ( 5 - 20 µg/mL ) dose-dependently suppressed the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level and interleukin (IL)-6 protein expression in interferon (IFN)-γ + TNF-α-treated HaCaT cells . The 2,4-dinitrocholrlbenzene (DNCB)-induced AD means atopic dermatitis animal model was developed by administering two AA means asiatic acid concentrations ( 30 and 75 mg/kg/d : AD means atopic dermatitis + AA-L and AD means atopic dermatitis + AA-H groups , respectively ) for 18 days . Interestingly , AA means asiatic acid treatment decreased AD means atopic dermatitis skin lesions formation and affected other AD means atopic dermatitis characteristics , such as increased ear thickness , lymph node and spleen size , dermal and epidermal thickness , collagen deposition , and mast cell infiltration in dorsal skin . In addition , in the DNCB-induced AD means atopic dermatitis animal model , AA means asiatic acid treatment downregulated the mRNA expression level of AD-related cytokines , such as Th1- ( TNF-α and IL-1β and -12 ) and Th2 ( IL-4 , -5 , -6 , -13 , and -31)-related cytokines as well as that of cyclooxygenase-2 and CXCL9 . Moreover , in the AA means asiatic acid treatment group , the protein level of inflammatory cytokines , including COX-2 , IL-6 , TNF-α , and IL-8 , as well as the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways , were decreased . Overall , our study confirmed that AA means asiatic acid administration inhibited AD means atopic dermatitis skin lesion formation via enhancing immunomodulation and inhibiting inflammation . Thus , AA means asiatic acid can be used as palliative medication for regulating AD means atopic dermatitis symptoms .\n",
        "Named after the two-faced Roman god of doorways , Janus kinases ( JAKs means Janus kinases ) represent a class of tyrosine kinases . The JAK signaling pathway is pivotal for the downstream signaling of inflammatory cytokines , including interleukins , interferons , and multiple growth factors . This article provides an overview of the JAK pathway and signaling , its significance in immune-mediated dermatologic diseases and the development of a targeted , localized option of a selective JAK inhibitor , ruxolitinib cream . In the early 1990s , various discovery and clinical development programs were initiated to explore pharmaceutical inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway . Incyte Corporation launched a strategy to identify molecules suitable for both topical as well as oral delivery . Ruxolitinib was designed as a molecule with low nanomolar potency selective for JAK1 and 2 enzymes , but without significant inhibition of non-JAK kinases , as well as physicochemical properties for both topical and oral administration . An oil-in-water emulsified ruxolitinib cream formulation was developed for topical application and was studied in multiple immune-mediated dermatologic diseases including psoriasis , alopecia areata , atopic dermatitis and vitiligo . Ruxolitinib cream represents a novel , JAK1/2 selective therapy that can be delivered directly to the skin to treat a number of cytokine-driven , inflammatory dermatoses .\n",

The functions of ABCB1 means Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 have been investigated extensively for their roles in cancer , stem cells , and drug resistance . Abundant pharmacogenetic studies have been conducted on ABCB1 means Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 and its association with treatment responsiveness to various agents , particularly chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory agents . However , its functions in the skin and implications on dermatotherapeutics are far less reported . In this article , we reviewed the roles of ABCB1 means Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 in dermatology . ABCB1 means Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 is expressed in the skin and its appendages during drug delivery and transport . It is associated with treatment responsiveness to various agents , including topical steroids , methotrexate , cyclosporine , azathioprine , antihistamines , antifungal agents , colchicine , tacrolimus , ivermectin , tetracycline , retinoid acids , and biologic agents .

        "The skin is the largest organ of the human body , and its dysfunction is related to many diseases . There is a need to find new potential effective therapies for some skin conditions such as inflammatory diseases , wound healing , or hair restoration . Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-conditioned medium ( CM means (MSC)-conditioned medium ) provides a potential opportunity in the treatment of skin disease . Thus , the objective of this review is to evaluate the uses of MSC-CM for treating skin diseases in both animal and human models . A systematic review was conducted regarding the use of MSC-CM for treating skin conditions . One hundred one studies were analyzed . MSC-CM was evaluated in wound healing ( 55 ) , hypertrophic scars ( 9 ) , flap reperfusion ( 4 ) , hair restoration ( 15 ) , skin rejuvenation ( 15 ) , and inflammatory skin diseases ( 3 ) . MSC-CM was obtained from different MSC sources , mainly adipose tissue , bone marrow , and umbilical cord blood . MSC-CM was tested intravenously , intraperitoneally , subcutaneously , intradermally or intralesionally injected or topically applied . MSC-CM was used in both animals and humans . MSC-CM improved wound healing , hair restoration , skin rejuvenation , atopic dermatitis , and psoriasis in both animals and humans . MSC-CM also decreased hypertrophic scars and flap ischemia in animal models . In conclusion , MSC-CM is a promising therapy for skin conditions . Further studies are needed to corroborate safety and effectiveness and to standardize CM means (MSC)-conditioned medium manufacturing .\n",
        "Dermatologists diagnose and treat many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases ( IMID means immune-mediated inflammatory diseases ) . Understanding the inherent immune dysregulation of these diseases as well as the additional disruption that comes as a result of IMID means immune-mediated inflammatory diseases treatments has been important during the COVID-19 pandemic . With vaccines becoming widely available , dermatologists need to be familiar with the risks and benefits of vaccination in these patients , particularly those taking biologics , in order to have informed discussions with their patients . In this review , we present the current evidence related to COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in patients with IMID means immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and review existing recommendations for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 . Given the current evidence , there is minimal concern that these patients are at any greater risk of harm from COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls . For most , the benefit of avoiding severe COVID-19 through vaccination will outweigh the theoretical risk of these vaccines . A question that is still outstanding is whether patients on biologics will generate a sufficient immune response to the vaccine , which may be dependent on the specific biologic therapy and indication being treated . This underscores the importance of following patients with IMID means immune-mediated inflammatory diseases after vaccination to determine the safety , efficacy , and duration of the vaccine in this population .\n",
        "Although ample knowledge exists about phenotype and function of cutaneous T lymphocytes , much less is known about the lymphocytic components of the skin 's innate immune system . To better understand the biologic role of cutaneous innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs means innate lymphoid cells ) , we investigated their phenotypic and molecular features under physiologic ( normal human skin [ NHS ] ) and pathologic ( lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis [ AD ] ) conditions . Skin punch biopsies and reduction sheets as well as blood specimens were obtained from either patients with AD or healthy individuals . Cell and/or tissue samples were analyzed by flow cytometry , immunohistochemistry , and single-cell RNA sequencing or subjected to in vitro/ex vivo culture . Notwithstanding substantial quantitative differences between NHS and AD skin , we found that the vast majority of cutaneous ILCs means innate lymphoid cells belong to the CRTH2<sup>+</sup > subset and reside in the upper skin layers . Single-cell RNA sequencing of cutaneous ILC-enriched cell samples confirmed the predominance of biologically heterogeneous group 2 ILCs means innate lymphoid cells and , for the first time , demonstrated considerable ILC lineage infidelity ( coexpression of genes typical of either type 2 [ GATA3 and IL13 ] or type 3/17 [ RORC , IL22 , and IL26 ] immunity within individual cells ) in lesional AD skin , and to a much lesser extent , in NHS . Similar events were demonstrated in ILCs means innate lymphoid cells from skin explant cultures and in vitro expanded ILCs means innate lymphoid cells from the peripheral blood . These findings support the concept that instead of being a stable entity with well-defined components , the skin immune system consists of a network of highly flexible cellular players that are capable of adjusting their function to the needs and challenges of the environment .\n",

        "During the last years , numerous studies have described the presence of significant gut and skin dysbiosis in some dermatological diseases such as atopic dermatitis , psoriasis and acne , among others . How the skin and the gut microbiome play a role in those skin conditions is something to explore , which will shed light on understanding the origin and implication of the microbiota in their pathophysiology . Several studies provide evidence for the influence of probiotic treatments that target the modulation of the skin and intestinal microbiota in those disorders and a positive influence of orally administered probiotics on the course of these dermatosis . The pathologies in which the therapeutic role of the probiotic has been explored are mainly atopic dermatitis , psoriasis and acne .

        "Investigation of changes in the skin microbiome following treatment of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) with dupilumab may provide valuable insights into the skin microbiome as a therapeutic target . The aim of this study is to assess changes in the AD means atopic dermatitis skin microbiome following treatment of AD means atopic dermatitis with dupilumab ( < i > n</i > = 27 ) . E-swabs were collected from nose , lesional , and nonlesional skin before and after 16 weeks of dupilumab therapy , and the microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA and < i > tuf</i > gene sequencing . Data for 17 patients with milder disease receiving treatment with non-targeted therapies are also presented . The results show that both groups experienced clinical improvement ( < i > p</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) following dupilumab therapy and that Shannon diversity increased and bacterial community structure changed .

        "The extracts of < i > Schisandra chinensis</i > ( Turcz . ) Baill . ( Schisandraceae ) have various therapeutic effects , including inflammation and allergy . In this study , gomisin M2 ( GM2 means gomisin M2 ) was isolated from < i > S. chinensis</i > and its beneficial effects were assessed against atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . We evaluated the therapeutic effects of GM2 means gomisin M2 on 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ( DNCB means 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ) and < i > Dermatophagoides farinae</i > extract (DFE)-induced AD-like skin lesions with BALB/c mice ears and within the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ-stimulated keratinocytes . The oral administration of GM2 means gomisin M2 resulted in reduced epidermal and dermal thickness , infiltration of tissue eosinophils , mast cells , and helper T cells in AD-like lesions . GM2 means gomisin M2 suppressed the expression of IL-1β , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-12a , and TSLP in ear tissue and the expression of IFN-γ , IL-4 , and IL-17A in auricular lymph nodes . GM2 means gomisin M2 also inhibited STAT1 and NF-κB phosphorylation in DNCB/DFE-induced AD-like lesions . The oral administration of GM2 means gomisin M2 reduced levels of IgE ( DFE-specific and total ) and IgG2a in the mice sera , as well as protein levels of IL-4 , IL-6 , and TSLP in ear tissues . In TNF-α/IFN-γ-stimulated keratinocytes , GM2 means gomisin M2 significantly inhibited IL-1β , IL-6 , CXCL8 , and CCL22 through the suppression of STAT1 phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Taken together , these results indicate that GM2 means gomisin M2 is a biologically active compound that exhibits inhibitory effects on skin inflammation and suggests that GM2 means gomisin M2 might serve as a remedy in inflammatory skin diseases , specifically on AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Ceramides , a class of sphingolipids containing a backbone of sphingoid base , are the most important and effective structural component for the formation of the epidermal permeability barrier . While ceramides comprise approximately 50 % of the epidermal lipid content by mass , the content is substantially decreased in certain inflammatory skin diseases , such as atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , causing improper barrier function . It is widely accepted that the endocannabinoid system ( ECS means endocannabinoid system ) can modulate a number of biological responses in the central nerve system , prior studies revealed that activation of endocannabinoid receptor CB1 , a key component of ECS means endocannabinoid system , triggers the generation of ceramides that mediate neuronal cell fate . However , as the impact of ECS means endocannabinoid system on the production of epidermal ceramide has not been studied , we here investigated whether the ECS means endocannabinoid system stimulates the generation of epidermal ceramides in an IL-4-treated in vitro model of skin inflammation using N-palmitoyl serinol ( PS means N-palmitoyl serinol ) , an analog of the endocannabinoid N-palmitoyl ethanolamine . Accordingly , an IL-4-mediated decrease in cellular ceramide levels was significantly stimulated in human epidermal keratinocytes ( KC means keratinocytes ) following PS means N-palmitoyl serinol treatment through both de novo ceramide synthesis- and sphingomyelin hydrolysis-pathways . Importantly , PS means N-palmitoyl serinol selectively increases ceramides with long-chain fatty acids ( FAs means fatty acids ) ( C22-C24 ) , which mainly account for the formation of the epidermal barrier , through activation of ceramide synthase ( CerS means ceramide synthase ) 2 and Cer3 in IL-4-mediated inflamed KC means keratinocytes . Furthermore , blockade of cannabinoid receptor CB1 activation by AM-251 failed to stimulate the production of total ceramide as well as long-chain ceramides in response to PS means N-palmitoyl serinol . These studies demonstrate that an analog of endocannabinoid , PS means N-palmitoyl serinol , stimulates the generation of specific ceramide species as well as the total amount of ceramides via the endocannabinoid receptor CB1-dependent mechanism , thereby resulting in the enhancement of epidermal permeability barrier function .\n",

Neferine is a small molecule compound isolated from the green embryo of the mature seeds of lotus ( < i > Nelumbo nucifera</i > ) . It has a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid structure . Relevant studies have shown that neferine has many pharmacological and biological activities , including anti-inflammatory , anti-thrombotic , and anti-diabetic activities . However , there are very few studies on neferine in the skin , especially the related effects on inflammatory skin diseases . In this study , we proved that it has the potential to be used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis . Through in vitro studies , we found that neferine inhibited the expression of cytokines and chemokines in TNF-α/IFN-γ-stimulated human keratinocyte ( HaCaT ) cells , and it reduced the phosphorylation of MAPK and the NF-κB signaling pathway . Through in vivo experiments , we used 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ( DNCB means 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ) to induce atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation in a mouse model . Our results show that neferine significantly decreased the skin barrier damage , scratching responses , and epidermal hyperplasia induced by DNCB means 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene . It significantly decreased transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) , erythema , blood flow , and ear thickness and increased surface skin hydration . Moreover , it also inhibited the expression of cytokines and the activation of signaling pathways . These results indicate that neferine has good potential as an alternative medicine for the treatment of atopic dermatitis or other skin-related inflammatory diseases .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD or eczema ) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorder worldwide . Ceramides ( Cer means Ceramides ) maintain skin barrier functions , which are disrupted in lesional skin of AD patients . However , Cer means Ceramides status during the pre-lesional phase of AD is not well defined . Using a variation of human AD-like preclinical model consisting of a 7-day topical exposure to ovalbumin ( OVA means ovalbumin ) , or control , we observed elevation of Cer means Ceramides C16 and C24 . Skin mRNA quantification of enzymes involved in Cer means Ceramides metabolism [ Cer means Ceramides synthases ( CerS means Cer synthases ) and ceramidases ( Asah1/Asah2 ) ] , which revealed augmented CerS means Cer synthases 4 , 5 and 6 and Asah1 . Given the overall pro-apoptotic nature of Cer means Ceramides , local apoptosis was assessed , then quantified using novel morphometric measurements of cleaved caspase (Casp)-3-restricted immunofluorescence signal in skin samples . Apoptosis was induced in response to OVA means ovalbumin . Because apoptosis may occur downstream of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER means endoplasmic reticulum ) stress , we measured markers of ER means endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and found elevated skin-associated CHOP protein upon OVA means ovalbumin treatment . We previously substantiated the importance of mast cells ( MC means mast cells ) in initiating early skin inflammation . OVA-induced Cer means Ceramides increase and local apoptosis were prevented in MC-deficient mice ; however , they were restored following MC means mast cells reconstitution . We propose that the MC/Cer axis is an essential pathogenic feature of pre-lesional AD , whose targeting may prevent disease development .\n",
        "Methylisothiazolinone ( MI means Methylisothiazolinone ) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone ( MCI means Methylchloroisothiazolinone ) are among the most common skin sensitizers , yet the immunological events that occur during MCI/MI allergic contact dermatitis ( ACD means allergic contact dermatitis ) are still poorly understood . To analyse dendrocytes , macrophage subtypes and T cells in skin during the elicitation phase of MCI/MI ACD means allergic contact dermatitis . Thirteen patients with positive patch test reactions to MCI/MI ( ACD means allergic contact dermatitis group ) and 11 individuals with negative patch test results were selected . Skin biopsies were only performed at 48 hours of patch testing . Immunohistochemistry was conducted to assess T cells , dendrocytes ( Factor XIIIa ) , M1 ( p-Stat1 , CD68 ) and M2 ( c-Maf , CD163 ) macrophages . Transcriptional analyses were performed for cytokines and related factors , and further compared to atopic dermatitis samples ( n=4 ) . Immunofluorescence assays addressed T cells location , along with IL-4 or IL-13 , within the skin . MCI/MI elicited dermal dendrocytes and macrophages , pronouncedly the M2 subtype . T cells , majorly CD4 + T cells , accumulated in the perivascular areas . Similarly , abundant IL-4 protein was detected in these areas . There was an upregulation of IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA expression , a mild increase in IFNG mRNA levels and a down-regulation of RORC in the ACD means allergic contact dermatitis group . Immunofluorescence revealed dermal clusters of T cells co-localized with IL-4 . M2 macrophages and Th2 cells participate in the immunopathogenesis of MCI/MI ACD means allergic contact dermatitis . Dermal dendrocytes and M2 macrophages may assist the formation of CD4 + T cells perivascular clusters . These findings render a mechanistic insight into the MCI/MI reaction . Further analysis at different timepoints of patch testing is required to fully comprehend this ACD means allergic contact dermatitis kinetics .\n",
        "Dupilumab is an antibody against interleukin 4 receptor α , used in treating atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adult Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis . In this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , phase III study , conducted between December 2018 and February 2020 , patients with AD means atopic dermatitis received dupilumab ( 300 mg ) or placebo once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks , and were followed up for 12 weeks . The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with both Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment ) score of 0 - 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at week 16 . Overall , 165 patients ( mean age : 30.6 years ; 71.5 % male ) were randomized : 82 to dupilumab and 83 to placebo . At week 16 , 26.8 % of patients in the dupilumab group and 4.8 % of patients in the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint ( difference , 22.0 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 11.37 - 32.65 % ; p&lt;0.0001 ) . Compared with placebo , higher proportions of patients in the dupilumab group achieved ≥75 % reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index score ( 57.3 % vs 14.5 % ; difference , 42.9 % ; 95 % CI , 29.75 - 55.97 % ; p&lt;0.0001 ) and had ≥3-point ( 52.4 % vs 9.6 % ; difference , 42.8 % ; 95 % CI , 30.26 - 55.34 % ; p&lt;0.0001 ) and ≥4-point ( 39.0 % vs 4.8 % ; difference , 34.2 % ; 95 % CI , 22.69 - 45.72 % ; p&lt;0.0001 ) reductions in weekly average daily peak daily pruritus numerical rating scale scores . The incidence of TEAEs during the treatment period was similar in the two groups . The incidence of conjunctivitis , allergic conjunctivitis , and injection site reaction was higher in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group . In adult Chinese patients , dupilumab was effective in improving the signs and symptoms of AD means atopic dermatitis and demonstrated a favorable safety profile .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a clinical syndrome that affects both people and animals . Dogs closely mimic the complexity of the human skin disease , and much progress has been made in recent years in terms of our understanding of the role of skin impairment and the identification of new treatments . Cats and horses also develop atopic syndromes which include both cutaneous and respiratory signs , yet studies in these species are lagging . It is now recognized that atopic dermatitis is not a single disease but a multifaceted clinical syndrome with different pathways in various subgroups of patients . Appreciating this complexity is clinically relevant as we develop more targeted treatments which may work well in some patients but not in others . Different phenotypes of atopic dermatitis have been described in dogs , and it is possible that phenotypes related to breed and age may exist in other animals similar to how they are described in people . The awareness of different mechanisms of disease leads to the desire to correlate different phenotypes with specific biomarkers and responses to treatment . In this review , the current understanding and updated information on atopic syndrome in animals are described , highlighting opportunities for further studies in the future .\n",
        "Phototherapy is an important method of dermatological treatments . Ultraviolet ( 280 - 400 nm ) therapy is of great importance ; however , there are concerns of its long-term use , as it can lead to skin aging and carcinogenesis . This review aims to evaluate the role and the mechanism of action of blue light ( 400 - 500 nm ) , a UV-free method . The main mediators of cellular responses to blue light are nitric oxide ( NO means nitric oxide ) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS means reactive oxygen species ) . However , the detailed mechanism is still not fully understood . It was demonstrated that blue light induces an anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effect ; thus , it may be beneficial for hyperproliferative and chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis , eczema , and psoriasis . It was also found that blue light might cause the reduction of itching . It may be beneficial on hair growth and may be used in the treatment of acne vulgaris by reducing follicular colonization of < i > Propionibacterium acnes</i>. Further studies are needed to develop accurate protocols , as the clinical effects depend on the light parameters as well as the treatment length . There are no major adverse effects observed yet , but long-term safety should be monitored as there are no studies considering the long-term effects of blue light on the skin .\n",
        "Allergic diseases , including atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , induce type 2 helper T ( Th2 ) cell-dominant immune responses . Miquelianin ( quercetin 3-<i > O</i>-glucuronide , MQL ) is an active compound in < i > Rosae multiflorae</i > fructus extract with anti-allergic properties . Here , we investigate the anti-allergic effects of MQL in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced Th2-dominant mouse model and the associated mechanisms . Oral MQL suppressed cytokine and IL-2 production and proliferation of Th2 cells and upregulated heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 means heme oxygenase-1 ) in splenocytes . Ex vivo MQL suppressed Th1- and Th2-related immune responses by inhibiting CD4<sup>+</sup > T cell proliferation , and upregulated HO-1 means heme oxygenase-1 in CD4<sup>+</sup > T cells by activating C-Raf-ERK1/2-Nrf2 pathway via induction of reactive oxygen species generation . In a trimellitic anhydride-induced AD-like mouse model , both topical and oral MQL ameliorated AD means atopic dermatitis symptoms by suppressing Th2 immune responses . Our results suggest that MQL is a potential therapeutic agent for CD4<sup>+</sup > T cell-mediated diseases , including allergic diseases .\n",
        "Skin , as a crucial external defense organ , is more vulnerable to oxidative stress ( OS means oxidative stress ) insult , reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated OS means oxidative stress in particular . OS means oxidative stress results from a redox imbalance caused by various extrinsic stimuli and occurs once the oxidants production overwhelming the antioxidants capacity , through mediating in DNA damage , lipid peroxidation ( LPO means lipid peroxidation ) , protein oxidation and a serial of signaling pathways activation/inactivation , thereby offering favorable conditions for the occurrence and development of numerous diseases especially some dermatoses , e.g. psoriasis , vitiligo , skin photodamage , skin cancer , systemic sclerosis ( SSc means systemic sclerosis ) , chloasma , atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , pemphigus , etc . Targeting OS means oxidative stress molecular mechanism , a variety of anti-OS agents emerge , in which flavonoids , natural plant extracts , stand out . To discuss the possible mechanisms of OS means oxidative stress mediating in dermatoses and summarize the properties of flavonoids as well as their applications in OS-related skin disorders . Published papers on flavonoids and OS-related skin diseases were collected and reviewed via database searching on PubMed , MEDLINE and Embase , etc . It has been confirmed that flavonoids , belonging to polyphenols , are a class of plant secondary metabolites widely distributed in various plants and possess diverse bioactivities especially their potent antioxidant capacity . Moreover , flavonoids benefit to suppress OS means oxidative stress via eliminating free radicals and mediating the corresponding signals , further excellently working in the prevention and management of OS-related skin diseases . Flavonoids have the potential therapeutic effects on oxidative stress-related dermatoses . However , more studies on specific mechanism as well as the dosage of flavonoids are needed in future .\n",
        "The prevalence of vitiligo has been reported to range from 0.1 % to 8 % worldwide , and vitiligo has been linked to some autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases . This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of vitiligo and associated comorbidities in adults in Shanghai . A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 9,114 adults ( 4,288 males ) in a community of Shanghai between October 2009 and January 2010 . Face-to-face interviews were conducted at the home of each participant , and all respondents had their skin examined by dermatologists . The risks of comorbidities associated with vitiligo were evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis . The estimated prevalence of vitiligo was 0.91 % , and the standardized ( age-adjusted ) prevalence was 0.67 % . Prevalence increased with age from 0.20 % in 18 - 30 years to 1.59 % in the 71 - 80 years age group . The presence of vitiligo was associated with increased risks of atopic dermatitis [ adjusted odds ratio ( aOR means adjusted odds ratio ) = 2.49 ; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ): 1.46 - 4.23 ] , urticaria ( aOR means adjusted odds ratio = 1.83 ; 95 % CI : 1.11 - 3.04 ) . and coronary heart disease ( aOR means adjusted odds ratio = 1.88 ; 95 % CI : 1.03 - 3.41 ) , although the association with coronary heart disease was only identified in subjects who were aged ≥60 years or overweight . The prevalence of vitiligo in Shanghai was comparable to that seen in previous studies and increased with age . Vitiligo was associated with increased risks of atopic dermatitis , urticaria , and coronary heart disease in adults .\n",
        "Increased presence of IL-22<sup>+</sup > cells in the skin is a characteristic finding in skin barrier defects , such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . However , mechanistic insight into effects of IL-22 on epidermal functioning is yet to be elucidated . One crucial step during epidermal differentiation is deimination or citrullination . Here , we show reduced levels of peptidylarginine deiminase 1 , an enzyme that converts peptidylarginine into citrulline in lesional psoriatic skin . IL-22 signaling through the IL-22 receptor complex was found to suppress expression of peptidylarginine deiminase 1 in epidermal keratinocytes . Subsequently , total peptidylarginine deiminase activity and extent of protein deimination in keratinocytes treated with IL-22 were reduced together with a significant decrease in deimination of keratin 1 and FLG , both important for epidermal differentiation . Vitamin D and acitretin partly restored the peptidylarginine deiminase 1 defect caused by IL-22 . Collectively , we show that IL-22 downregulates deimination , thus identifying a potential target for treatment of skin barrier defects .\n",

We describe the rates of reporting race , ethnicity , and skin tone in studies testing the psychometric properties of AD means atopic dermatitis outcome measures and compare the psychometric analyses across race , ethnicity , and skin tone . We systematically reviewed MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reporting psychometric properties of clinician-reported or patient-reported outcome measures in AD means atopic dermatitis ( International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews : CRD42021239614 ) . Overall , 16,100 nonduplicate articles were screened ; 165 met inclusion criteria . Race and/or ethnicity were reported in 55 ( 33.3 % ) studies ; of those , race was assessed by self-report in 10 studies ( 6.1 % ) or was unspecified in 45 ( 27.3 % ) . A total of 16 studies ( 9.7 % ) evaluated psychometric property differences by race , and only five ( 4.4 % ) of those did not recognize it as a limitation . Properties assessed across race , ethnicity , or skin tone were differential item functioning , convergent validity feasibility , inter-rater reliability , intrarater reliability , test‒retest reliability , and known-groups validity . Multiple instruments demonstrated performance differences across ethnoracial groups . This review highlights the paucity of race/ethnicity consideration for psychometric property testing in AD means atopic dermatitis outcome measurement instruments . More AD means atopic dermatitis outcomes instruments should be validated in diverse populations .\n",

Heads Up was a 24-week , head-to-head , phase 3b , multicenter , randomized , double-blinded , double-dummy , active-controlled clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib with dupilumab among 692 adults with moderate-to-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis who were candidates for systemic therapy . The study was conducted from February 21 , 2019 , to December 9 , 2020 , at 129 centers located in 22 countries across Europe , North and South America , Oceania , and the Asia-Pacific region . Efficacy analyses were conducted in the intent-to-treat population . Patients were randomized 1:1 and treated with oral upadacitinib , 30 mg once daily , or subcutaneous dupilumab , 300 mg every other week . The primary end point was achievement of 75 % improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI75 ) at week 16 . Secondary end points were percentage change from baseline in the Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS means Numerical Rating Scale ) ( weekly average means weekly average) at week 1, and Worst Pruritus NRS average ) , proportion of patients achieving EASI100 and EASI90 at week 16 , percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS means Numerical Rating Scale at week 4 , proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week 2 , percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS means Numerical Rating Scale ( weekly average means weekly average) at week 1, and Worst Pruritus NRS average ) at week 1 , and Worst Pruritus NRS means Numerical Rating Scale ( weekly average means weekly average) at week 1, and Worst Pruritus NRS average ) improvement of 4 points or more at week 16 . End points at week 24 included EASI75 , EASI90 , EASI100 , and improvement of 4 points or more in Worst Pruritus NRS means Numerical Rating Scale from baseline ( weekly average means weekly average) at week 1, and Worst Pruritus NRS average ) . Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events in all patients receiving 1 or more dose of either drug . Of 924 patients screened , 348 ( 183 men [ 52.6 % ] ; mean [ SD ] age , 36.6 [ 14.6 ] years ) were randomized to receive upadacitinib and 344 were randomized to receive dupilumab ( 194 men [ 56.4 % ] ; mean [ SD ] age , 36.9 [ 14.1 ] years ) ; demographic and disease characteristics were balanced among treatment groups . At week 16 , 247 patients receiving upadacitinib ( 71.0 % ) and 210 patients receiving dupilumab ( 61.1 % ) achieved EASI75 ( P = .006 ) . All ranked secondary end points also demonstrated the superiority of upadacitinib vs dupilumab , including improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS means Numerical Rating Scale as early as week 1 ( mean [ SE ] , 31.4 % [ 1.7 % ] vs 8.8 % [ 1.8 % ] ; P & lt ; .001 ) , achievement of EASI75 as early as week 2 ( 152 [ 43.7 % ] vs 60 [ 17.4 % ] ; P & lt ; .001 ) , and achievement of EASI100 at week 16 ( 97 [ 27.9 % ] vs 26 [ 7.6 % ] ; P & lt ; .001 ) . Rates of serious infection , eczema herpeticum , herpes zoster , and laboratory-related adverse events were higher for patients who received upadacitinib , whereas rates of conjunctivitis and injection-site reactions were higher for patients who received dupilumab . During 16 weeks of treatment , upadacitinib demonstrated superior efficacy vs dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis , with no new safety signals .

        "During the COVID-19 pandemic , prolonged usage of personal protective equipment ( PPE means protective equipment ) and frequent handwashing has exacerbated or caused skin diseases , particularly amongst frontline workers . Skin conditions , such as atopic dermatitis , irritant contact dermatitis , and hand eczema , affect patients ’ quality of life and their ability to work . These conditions can be managed by frequent moisturization and washing with gentle cleansers . In this review , we discuss the properties of effective moisturizers and cleansers for patients with skin diseases related to enhanced infection control procedures .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a heterogenous disorder and can be classified into different types . Stratification of subtypes may enable personalized medicine approaches . AD means Atopic dermatitis can be categorized into the IgE-high , extrinsic subtype and the IgE-normal , intrinsic subtype . While extrinsic AD means Atopic dermatitis is the major subtype possessing skin barrier impairment ( high incidence of filaggrin mutations ) , intrinsic AD means Atopic dermatitis occupies about 20 % of AD means Atopic dermatitis with female dominance and preserved barrier . Extrinsic AD means Atopic dermatitis exhibits protein allergy and food allergy , but intrinsic AD means Atopic dermatitis shows metal allergy possibly in association with suprabasin deficiency . In particular , accumulated knowledge of food allergy has more clearly characterized extrinsic AD means Atopic dermatitis . European American ( EA means European American ) and Asian AD means Atopic dermatitis subtypes have been also proposed . Asian patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis are characterized by a unique blended immune dysregulation and barrier feature phenotype between EA means European American patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis and those with psoriasis . In another ethnic study , filaggrin loss-of-function mutations are not prevalent in African American patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , and Th1/Th17 attenuation and Th2/Th22 skewing were seen in these patients . Recent endotype classification provides new insights for AD means Atopic dermatitis and other allergic disorders . Endotype is defined as the molecular mechanisms underlying the visible features/phenotype . Endotype repertoire harbors activation of type 2 cytokines , type 1 cytokines , and IL-17/IL-22 , impairment of epidermal barrier , and abnormalities of intercellular lipids . Classification of endotype has been attempted with serum markers . These lines of evidence indicate a need for personalized or precision medicine appropriate for each subtype of AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "The occurrence of allergic conditions , for example allergic asthma , rhinitis , and atopic dermatitis , is rising worldwide . These allergic conditions are associated with poor life quality . Vitamin D is proposed to be linked with increased risk and severe forms of allergic diseases . This review article aimed to evaluate the vitamin D level role and polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene ( VDR means vitamin D receptor gene ) in atopy . We analyzed publications that were focusing on levels of vitamin D and/or polymorphism analysis of vitamin D receptor gene in allergic asthma , rhinitis , and atopic dermatitis patients . We noticed that levels of vitamin D are extensively studied in atopy by many research groups , however , polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene and their link with levels of vitamin D lack comprehensive data . There is evidence that vitamin D may be associated with anti-inflammatory effects in allergic diseases . Some of VDR means vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms also may play a role in pathogenesis of these diseases . However , the data from different studies are controversial . The results of different studies are usually inconsistent , most probably due to populational bias or differences in methodology . Even though , more evidence shows a positive impact of vitamin D on the risk and outcomes of allergic diseases , especially atopic dermatitis , and asthma . There is controversial data about the level of vitamin D and its role in atopy ; however , more evidence shows a positive impact on the risk and outcomes of allergic diseases .\n",
        "Prurigo nodularis ( PN means Prurigo nodularis ) is a highly pruritic disease that significantly impairs patient quality of life . Although the mechanism that causes pruritus is not clear , one hypothesis argues that neural hyperplasia , mast cell , and Merkel cell neurite complexes may be associated with PN means Prurigo nodularis pathogenesis . The objective of this study was to analyze whether special staining outcomes differed depending on the presence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and treatment response . A total of 209 patients diagnosed with PN means Prurigo nodularis was analyzed retrospectively . Patients were divided into two groups according to presence or past history of AD means atopic dermatitis and by treatment response . Histopathologic features were obtained using the following stains : Giemsa , S-100 , neuron-specific enolase , cytokeratin (CK)-20 , CAM5.2 , and CK8/CK18 . A total of 126 patients ( 60.29 % ) had AD means atopic dermatitis , and 68 ( 32.54 % ) showed clinical improvement . There were no statistically significant differences in the staining results between the PN means Prurigo nodularis groups with AD means atopic dermatitis ( PN means Prurigo nodularis c AD means atopic dermatitis ) and without AD means atopic dermatitis ( PN means Prurigo nodularis s AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Additionally , there were no statistically significant differences in staining results between the improved and non-improved groups . Implementing the special stains helped to identify PN means Prurigo nodularis pathogenesis . Because there were no statistically significant differences in the special stain results between the improved and non-improved groups , we conclude that mast cell proliferation , neural hyperplasia , and Merkel cell hyperplasia may not have a significant effect on treatment response .\n",
        "CARD11 is a multidomain scaffold protein required for normal activation of NF-κB , JNK , and mTOR during Ag receptor signaling . Germline CARD11 mutations cause at least three types of primary immunodeficiency including CARD11 deficiency , B cell expansion with NF-κB and T cell anergy ( BENTA means B cell expansion with NF-κB and T cell anergy ) , and CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-κB signaling ( CADINS means CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-κB signaling ) . CADINS means CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-κB signaling is uniquely caused by heterozygous loss-of-function CARD11 alleles that act as dominant negatives . CADINS means CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-κB signaling patients present with frequent respiratory and skin infections , asthma , allergies , and atopic dermatitis . However , precisely how a heterozygous dominant negative CARD11 allele leads to the development of this CADINS-specific cluster of symptoms remains poorly understood . To address this , we generated mice expressing the CARD11 R30W allele originally identified in patients . We find that CARD11<sup > R30W/+</sup > mice exhibit impaired signaling downstream of CARD11 that leads to defects in T , B , and NK cell function and immunodeficiency . CARD11<sup > R30W/+</sup > mice develop elevated serum IgE levels with 50 % penetrance that becomes more pronounced with age , but do not develop spontaneous atopic dermatitis . CARD11<sup > R30W/+</sup > mice display reduced regulatory T cell numbers , but not the Th2 expansion observed in other mice with diminished CARD11 activity . Interestingly , the presence of mixed CARD11 oligomers in CARD11<sup > R30W/+</sup > mice causes more severe signaling defects in T cells than in B cells , and specifically impacts IFN-γ production by NK cells , but not NK cell cytotoxicity . Our findings help explain the high susceptibility of CADINS means CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-κB signaling patients to infection and suggest that the development of high serum IgE is not sufficient to induce overt atopic symptoms .\n",
        "A high number of biologically active and low-calcemic secosteroidal ligands of the vitamin D receptor ( VDR means vitamin D receptor ) have been developed , some of which are already used clinically although with limited success in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases because the required pharmaceutical dosages induce toxicity . We describe here the in silico design , synthesis , structural analysis and biological evaluation of two novel active lithocholic acid derivatives hydroxylated at the side chain as highly potent inhibitors of atopic dermatitis-relevant keratinocyte inflammation of potential therapeutic interest .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a common inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions and intense itch . Although it most often starts in infancy and affects children , it is also highly prevalent in adults . In this article , the main aspects of AD means Atopic dermatitis have been updated , with a focus on the pathogenetic and therapeutic aspects . The pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis is complex , and it is evident that a strong genetic predisposition , epidermal dysfunction , skin microbiome abnormalities , immune dysregulation , and the neuroimmune system are critical in AD means Atopic dermatitis development . Mutations in the genes associated with disrupted epidermal barrier , exaggerated pathological inflammation and inadequate antimicrobial peptides can promote enhanced Th2 inflammation and mediate pruritus . Current understanding of etiology highlights gut microbial diversity , NK cell deficiency , and different immunological phenotype with age and race . For topical anti-inflammatory treatment for mild-to-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis , phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors ( PDE-4 means phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors ) , JAK inhibitors , and microbiome transplantation with Roseomonas mucosa provided more management selections . The treatment of moderate-to-severe AD means Atopic dermatitis has been limited to merely symptomatic and relatively nonspecific immunosuppressive approaches . In-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis has led to the development of innovative and targeted therapies , such as biologic agents targeting interleukin (IL)-4 , IL-13 and JAK/STAT inhibitors . Other potential therapeutic agents for AD means Atopic dermatitis include agents targeting the T helper ( Th means T helper ) 22 and Th17/IL23 pathway . Antipruritic therapy and complementary probiotics therapy have also been reviewed .\n",
        "Feline Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index ( FEDESI means Feline Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index ) and Scoring Feline Allergic Dermatitis ( SCORFAD means Scoring Feline Allergic Dermatitis ) are scales used to assess lesion severity in cats with allergic dermatitis .

        "We recently reported children with comorbid atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , asthma , allergic rhinitis , and food allergies displaying a 2.7-fold increase in developmental delays.<sup>2</sup > To this end , we hypothesize unregulated increases in T helper-2 (Th2)-driven inflammation , such as those seen in atopic diseases , can exert deleterious effects on the developing brain . Recognizing that available information is incomplete and that many potential associations are not firmly established , we speculate these effects underlie the association between Th2 sensitization and cognitive dysfunction in children . In this review , we explore the role of Th2 sensitization in the skin-gut-brain axis and explain how it can lead to reduced connectivity and transmission in the developing brain . With a focus on AD means atopic dermatitis , we explore the association between Th2 sensitization and developmental abnormalities such as developmental delays , memory impairment , autism spectrum disorder ( ASD means autism spectrum disorder ) , and epilepsy/seizures . As such , we review the available literature to examine the impact of increased IL-4 exposure in early life on the brain . We explore the possible association between Th2 sensitization and psychologic dysfunction such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD means attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ) , depression , anxiety , and suicidal ideation . We also examine the impact that increased exposure to glucocorticoids and neurotrophins in early life exerts on the developing brain . Last , we discuss future directions for the advancement of our knowledge as a scientific community including possible interventions to reduce developmental and psychologic aberrations in children .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a public health concern and is increasing in prevalence in urban areas . Recent advances in sequencing technology have demonstrated that the development of AD means Atopic dermatitis not only associate with the skin microbiome but gut microbiota . Gut microbiota plays an important role in allergic diseases including AD means Atopic dermatitis . The hypothesis of the \" gut-skin \" axis has been proposed and the cross-talk mechanism between them has been gradually demonstrated in the research . Probiotics contribute to the improvement of the intestinal environment , the balance of immune responses , regulation of metabolic activity . Most studies suggest that probiotic supplements may be an alternative for the prevention and treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis . This study aimed to discuss the effects of probiotics on the clinical manifestation of AD means Atopic dermatitis based on gut microbial alterations . Here we reviewed the gut microbial alteration in patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , the association between gut microbiota , epidermal barrier , and toll-like receptors , and the interaction of probiotics and gut microbiota . The potential mechanisms of probiotics on alleviating AD means Atopic dermatitis < i > via</i > upregulation of epidermal barrier and regulation of immune signaling had been discussed , and their possible effective substances on AD means Atopic dermatitis had been explored . This provides the supports for targeting gut microbiota to attenuate AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Dermal fibroblasts are strategically positioned underneath the basal epidermis layer to support keratinocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix production . In inflammatory conditions , these fibroblasts produce cytokines and chemokines that promote the chemoattraction of immune cells into the dermis and the hyperplasia of the epidermis , two characteristic hallmarks of Psoriasis ( Pso means Psoriasis ) . However , how dermal fibroblasts specifically contribute to Pso means Psoriasis development remains largely uncharacterized . Here we investigated through which cytokines and signaling pathways dermal fibroblasts contribute to the inflammatory features of psoriatic skin . We show that dermal fibroblasts from lesional Pso means Psoriasis skin are important producers of inflammatory mediators , including IL6 , CXCL8 and CXCL2 . This increased cytokine production was found to be regulated by ZFP36 family members ZFP36 , ZFP36L1 and ZPF36L2 , RNA-binding proteins with mRNA-degrading properties . Additionally , the expression of ZFP36 family proteins was found reduced in chronic inflammatory conditions that mimic psoriatic lesional skin . Collectively , these results indicate that dermal fibroblasts are important producers of cytokines in psoriatic skin , and that reduced expression of ZFP36 members in Pso means Psoriasis dermal fibroblasts contributes to their inflammatory phenotype .\n",
        "As the number of patients with skin allergies , including atopic dermatitis , has increased rapidly , therapeutic options such as anti-IL-31 antibody and Janus kinase inhibitor have been developed recently . However , many concerns remain regarding the adverse effects and cost of these drugs ; therefore , development of supplements that could support the effect of therapeutic agents is always required . The aim of this study was to develop preventive and supportive options for skin allergies by focusing on a natural product called \" Mastic \" . Initially , the anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic responses of 3 % and 30 % Mastic topical treatment were investigated in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis , generated by topical application of toluene-2,4-diisocyanate ( TDI means toluene-2,4-diisocyanate ) , a hapten that induces type 2 helper T cells . After itch behaviour and ear-swelling response were monitored , serum , auricular lymph nodes , and skin tissues were collected to analyse immunocyte differentiation , cytokine determination , and histological changes . Our findings indicated that topical treatment with mastic significantly ameliorated ear swelling , itch behaviour , immunocyte infiltration , and cytokine production . Histological evaluation confirmed the occurrence of anti-inflammatory responses . The anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic effects of topical treatment with mastic ( 3 % and 5 % ) were further confirmed in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis which was generated by topical application of TDI means toluene-2,4-diisocyanate in NC/Nga mice . Thickness of the back skin , AD score , transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) , and itch behaviour were measured weekly , and immunocyte differentiation , cytokine determination , and histological changes were also analysed . Mastic treatment significantly attenuated the skin thickness , AD score , TEWL means transepidermal water loss , and itch behaviour . Corroborated reduction was observed in the numbers of T cells and IgE-B cells , as well as in pro-inflammatory cytokine production . The reproducibility of the effects of mastic was confirmed with 1 % mastic ointment in a setting similar to the AD mouse model . In vitro evaluation of keratinocytes indicated that mastic pre-exposure induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in cytokine production . Our findings thus demonstrate that topical treatment with mastic significantly ameliorate inflammatory and pruritic responses in a mouse model of allergic dermatitis .\n",
        "Viola yedoensis Makiho ( VY , Violaceae ) is a well-known medicinal herb in Chinese medicine , which is traditionally used to treat inflammation-related disorders , including allergic skin reactions . Although studies have uncovered its anti-inflammatory effects and corresponding bioactive constituents , the exact mechanism of action is still unclear in treating allergic skin reactions . Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by severe pruritus , dry , edema and inflamed skin . It affects people 's quality of life seriously and causes huge economic losses to society . This study proposes VY as a possible remedy for atopic dermatitis since its traditional usage and superior anti-inflammatory effects . Atopic dermatitis-like skin lesion was induced by topical application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ( DNCB means 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ) in ICR mice . After treatment with Viola yedoensis Makiho ethanol extract ( VYE means Viola yedoensis Makiho ethanol extract ) or dexamethasone ( positive control ) for 3 weeks , skin pathological observation and the molecular biological index were performed for therapeutic evaluation , including visual inspection in the change of the stimulated skin , scar formation , pathological morphology by hematoxylin and eosin ( HE means hematoxylin and eosin ) staining , the measurement of interleukin IL-1β , IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) levels in serum as well as spleen index . The expression of inducible NO synthase ( iNOS means inducible NO synthase ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 means cyclooxygenase-2 ) were analyzed by western blot . The ratio of CD4+/CD8 + T lymphocyte in the spleen was detected by flow cytometry . Meanwhile , immunohistochemistry staining for CD68 identified the number of activated macrophages in skin lesions . Additionally , a reliable ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a Q exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry ( UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS ) method was established for the systematic identification and characterization of main components in VYE means Viola yedoensis Makiho ethanol extract . VYE means Viola yedoensis Makiho ethanol extract alleviated DNCB-stimulated AD-like lesions symptoms as evidenced by a significant decrease in hypertrophy , hyperkeratosis , and infiltration of inflammatory cells in dorsal skin . The levels of IL-1β , IL-6 , and TNF-α in serum were suppressed in mice treated with VYE means Viola yedoensis Makiho ethanol extract as compared to the DNCB-induced model group . Also , the administration of VYE means Viola yedoensis Makiho ethanol extract reduced the ratio of CD4+/CD8 + T lymphocyte in the spleen and the number of activated macrophages stimulated by DNCB means 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene . Besides , the expression of iNOS means inducible NO synthase and COX-2 means cyclooxygenase-2 were down-regulated in the dorsal skin . VYE means Viola yedoensis Makiho ethanol extract showed therapeutic effects on atopic dermatitis in DNCB-induced AD-like lesion mouse models by inhibiting the T cell-mediated allergic immune response . Our results indicated that VY could act as a potential remedy for atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) and psoriasis are highly prevalent , complex , chronic inflammatory skin diseases that immensly affect the patient 's quality of life . While there is no definitive cure for these conditions , suppressive medications aim at managing the symptoms of these diseases . The application of emollients accompanied by symptomatic anti-inflammatory therapy consisting of topical corticosteroids ( TCS means topical corticosteroids ) is extensively employed for controlling the symptoms among general practitioners making this therapeutic class an indispensable pillar of dermatotherapeutics . The first TCS means topical corticosteroids , hydrocortisone ( HC means hydrocortisone ) introduced in the early 1950s led to the development of different steroidal moieties of varying potencies by inducing chemical modifications to the basic steroid structure . The wide spectrum of the available range of formulations and potency provides flexibility to treat all patient groups , different phases of the diseases , and different anatomical sites . Conventional TCS means topical corticosteroids therapy suffers from drawbacks such as low drug permeation and retention rate . Thus , novel nanoformulations have been developed to overcome these problems . This review provides an insight into the current state of nanocarrier-mediated topical delivery of corticosteroids monotherapy and combination therapy with special emphasis on targeting psoriasis and AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "This study deals with detecting the associations of atopic dermatitis ' ( AD means atopic dermatitis' ) phenotypes in children : alone or combined with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis ( SARC means seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis ) and/or perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR means perennial allergic rhinitis ) , and/or with bronchial asthma ( BA means bronchial asthma ) with single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP means single nucleotide polymorphisms ) of filaggrin ( FLG means filaggrin ) , thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP means thymic stromal lymphopoietin ) and orsomucoid-like-1 protein 3 ( ORMDL3 means orsomucoid-like-1 protein 3 ) genes . Male and female pediatric patients aged from 3 to 18 years old were recruited into the main ( AD means atopic dermatitis' in different combinations with SARC means seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis , PAR means perennial allergic rhinitis , BA means bronchial asthma ) and control groups ( disorders of digestives system , neither clinical nor laboratory signs of atopy ) . Patients were genotyped for SNP means single nucleotide polymorphisms of rs_7927894 FLG means filaggrin , rs_11466749 TSLP means thymic stromal lymphopoietin , rs_7216389 ORMDL3 means orsomucoid-like-1 protein 3 variants . Statistically significant associations of the increased risk were detected of AD means atopic dermatitis' combined with SARC means seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and/or PAR means perennial allergic rhinitis and AD means atopic dermatitis' combined with BA means bronchial asthma ( possibly , SARC means seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and/or PAR means perennial allergic rhinitis ) with C/T rs_7927894 FLG means filaggrin and T/T rs_7216389 ORMDL3 means orsomucoid-like-1 protein 3 genotypes . Genotype C/C rs_7927894 FLG means filaggrin significantly decreases the risk of AD means atopic dermatitis' combined with SARC means seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and/or PAR means perennial allergic rhinitis by 2.56 fold . Several genotypes ' associations had a trend to significance : C/C rs_7216389 ORMDL3 means orsomucoid-like-1 protein 3 decreases and C/T rs_7216389 ORMDL3 means orsomucoid-like-1 protein 3 increases the risk for developing AD means atopic dermatitis' alone phenotype ; A/G rs_11466749 TSLP means thymic stromal lymphopoietin decreases the risk of AD means atopic dermatitis' combined with BA means bronchial asthma ( possibly , SARC means seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and/or PAR means perennial allergic rhinitis ) phenotype development .\n",
        "It is difficult to identify young children at increased risk of developing asthma amongst those with recurrent wheezing . In this study , we aimed to determine factors associated with asthma in Turkish children . We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis on factors associated with asthma in 651 children ( 200 girls , 451 boys ) admitted for recurrent wheezing . Amongst all included children , asthma frequency was 57.7 % . Maturity , consanguinity , family income , passive smoking , father 's , siblings ' asthma were not found to be associated with asthma . Factors associated with asthma were : family 's , parents ' , siblings ' atopy , family 's , mother 's asthma , allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis , respiratory symptoms between wheezing attacks . The sensitivity ( SN means sensitivity ) of the modified asthma predictive index ( mAPI means modified asthma predictive index ) was 59.2 % with a specificity ( SP means specificity ) of 91.3 % , positive predictive index ( PPI means positive predictive index ) of 65.1 % and negative predictive index ( NPI means negative predictive index ) of 82.3 % . The SN means sensitivity of the modified Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy ( PIAMA means Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy ) score was 22.9 % with a SP means specificity of 89.2 % , PPI means positive predictive index of 84.6 % , and NPI means negative predictive index of 42.2 % . Adjusted odds ratio for mAPI means modified asthma predictive index was 12.9 , and for the modified PIAMA means Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy score 4 . Our analysis confirmed previously described factors associated with asthma . Although the SN means sensitivity is limited , the mAPI means modified asthma predictive index and PIAMA means Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy risk scores can be used to predict asthma in Turkish children . Differential diagnoses and overlaps with other chronic pediatric diseases such as immunodeficiencies need to be carefully excluded when confirming the diagnosis asthma . Es ist schwierig , unter Kindern mit wiederkehrendem Giemen jene zu identifizieren , die ein Asthma entwickeln . In der vorliegenden Arbeit untersuchten wir die Faktoren , unter türkischen Kindern mit wiederholt giemender Atmung , die mit Asthma assoziiert sind . In einer retropsektiven Analyse untersuchten wir die Faktoren , die mit Asthma assoziiert sind unter 651 Kindern ( 200 Mädchen , 451 Jungen ) , mit wiederkehrendem Giemen . Die Asthmahäufigkeit unter allen analysierten Patienten betrug 57,7 % . Frühgeburtlichkeit , Konsanguinität der Eltern , Familieneinkommen , Passivrauchen , Asthma von Vater , Geschwistern zeigten sich nicht als mit Asthma assoziiert . Mit Asthma assoziiert waren : Atopie in der Familie unter Eltern und Geschwistern , positive Familienanamnese für Asthma ; allergische Rhinitis und atopische Dermatitis ; Atemwegsbeschwerden zwischen den Giemen Perioden . Die Sensitivität ( SN means sensitivity ) des modifizierten asthma predictive index ( mAPI means modified asthma predictive index ) für Asthma betrug 59,2 % , die Spezifität ( SP means specificity ) betrug 91,3 % , der positive Vorhersageindex ( PPI means positive predictive index ) betrug 65,1 % und der negative Vorhersageindex ( NPI means negative predictive index ) 82,3 % . Die Sensitivität der modifizierten Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy ( PIAMA means Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy ) Risikobewertung betrug 22,9 % bei einer SP means specificity von 89,2 % , PPI means positive predictive index von 84,6 % und NPI means negative predictive index von 42,2 % . Die angepasste Odds-Ratio für mAPI means modified asthma predictive index lag bei 12,9 und für die modifizierte PIAMA-Risikobewertung bei 4 . Die mit Asthma assoziierte bisherigen Faktoren wurden in unserer Studie bestätigt . Obwohl unsere Studie eine niedrige SN means sensitivity zeigten , können die mAPI means modified asthma predictive index und die modifizierte PIAMA-Ergebnisse hilfreich sein , Asthma unter türkischen Kindern vorherzusagen . Wichtig dabei ist es bei der Beurteilung des Asthmarisikos unter Kindern mit wiederkehrendem Giemen , das relevante Differentialdiagnosen wie z. B. İmmundefekte , augeschlossen werden .\n",
        "A Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM means Traditional Chinese Medicine ) formula ( VYAC ) consists of three herbs including Viola yedoensis Makino , herb ( Violaceae , Viola ) , Sophora flavescens Aiton , root ( Fabaceae , Sophora ) and Dictamnus dasycarpus Turcz , root and rhizome ( Rutaceae , Dictamnus ) , has been traditionally prescribed to treat various skin diseases in clinic . This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of VYAC on the 2,4-dinitrobenzene ( DNCB ) induced atopic dermatitis (AD)-like mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms . VYAC was extracted with 70 % aqueous ethanol and lyophilized powder was used . AD-like mice were challenged by DNCB , VYAC ( 150 and 300 mg/kg ) were oral administration daily from day 7 to day 28 . At the end of experiment , the clinical scores were recorded , serum and skin in the dorsal were isolated to evaluate the therapeutic effects of VYAC . RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with C48/80 for degranulation and plasmids expressing constitutively active form of Syk ( Silence or overexpression ) were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells to explore the underlying mechanisms in vitro . VYAC significantly ameliorated the cardinal symptoms in the DNCB-induced AD-like mice by repairing the skin barrier function , inhibiting mast cells infiltration , restraining the serum IgE and histamine release and decreasing TNF-α , IL-4 as well as Syk mRNA level in dorsal skin and alleviating inflammation . Besides , VYAC significantly blocked RBL-2H3 cells degranulation , reduced β-hexosaminidase and histamine release , and suppressed NF-κB pathway . What 's more , the degranulation of RBL-2H3 was reduced after Syk silence and increased after Syk overexpression . Our findings clearly suggested that VYAC treat AD through inhibiting the inflammatory mediator productions and blocking mast cell degranulation via suppressing Syk mediated NF-κB pathway .\n",
        "Inclusion of female authors has been noted as potentially beneficial in the development of medical guidelines . Japanese professional committees representing allergic subspecialties develop practical guidelines with recommendations to caregivers , but these committees may be influenced by their gender composition . The objective of our study was to examine the influence of gender in developing pediatric allergic disease guidelines in Japan from 1999 to 2020 . We examined the gender differences among the guideline committee members : allergic rhinitis , atopic dermatitis , bronchial asthma , and food allergies in Japan . We examined the gender composition of the committees , annual trends , and differences in guideline content . The median proportion of women members among the 22 guidelines committees was 6.6 % ( range : 0%-27.3 % ) . The analysis of the quadrant period did not show a significant increase in the proportion of female members . The food allergy group had a significantly higher proportion of female members than other guidelines ( P & lt ; 0.01 ) , but the proportion decreased from 25 % to 14.3 % during the observation period . For the pediatric asthma guidelines , the proportion of female committee members decreased from 5.3 % in the 2000 version to 0 % in the most recent revision in 2017 . The proportion of women on the committees that develop pediatric guidelines continues to be low and has not improved over the past 20 years .\n",
        "We present the results of a retrospective data analysis of a practice cohort of 44 patients with atopic dermatitis treated with the IL-4/13 receptor antibody dupilumab for up to 3 years . Patients were followed up over a period of 21 months during specialized consultation hours named Immunodermatology , which was established to guarantee comprehensive documentation . The patient 's characteristics regarding age and sex distribution , severity and duration of disease were comparable with the patient collectives in large , pivotal studies . The therapeutic efficiency however was high ( percentage of patients with EASI50 , -75 , -90 after 16 weeks : 94 , 84 , 60 % , respectively ) and long lasting ( 86 % EASI90 after 52 weeks on therapy ) under everyday conditions in the clinical setting . Approximately half of the patients had facial skin or eye involvement either in their history or at the start of treatment . This group of patients proved to need more and intense care because facial dermatitis and periocular dermatitis , which often involved conjunctivitis , took longer to heal , relapses occurred , and an additional topical treatment was often required . We did not observe any severe side effects during the 48 patient-years analyzed in this study . Dupilumab proved to be a safe and efficient treatment for atopic dermatitis in dermatological practice . Wir präsentieren die Ergebnisse einer retrospektiven Datenauswertung von 44 Patienten einer Praxiskohorte , deren atopische Dermatitis ( AD means atopische Dermatitis ) über bis zu 3 Jahre mit dem IL(Interleukin)-4/13-Rezeptor-Antikörper Dupilumab behandelt wurde . Die Betreuung erfolgte in den letzten 21 Monaten in einer Spezialsprechstunde Immundermatologie , in der die aufwendige Dokumentation realisiert werden konnte . Die Charakteristika der Kohorte hinsichtlich Alters- und Geschlechterverteilung , Schwere und Dauer der Erkrankung sind vergleichbar mit den großen Patientenkollektiven der Zulassungsstudien . Die therapeutische Effizienz unter Praxis-Alltagsbedingungen erwies sich als sehr gut ( Anteil Patienten EASI [ Eczema Area and Severity Index ] 50 , 75 , 90 nach 16 Wochen : 94 , 84 , 60 % ) und anhaltend ( 86 % EASI 90 nach 52 Wochen Therapie ) . Etwa die Hälfte unserer Patienten hatte anamnestisch oder bei Therapiebeginn eine Beteiligung der Gesichtshaut und/oder Augen . Diese Patientengruppe erwies sich als betreuungsintensiver , weil die Gesichts- und periorbitale Dermatitis sowie begleitende Konjunktividen verzögert abheilten , zu Rezidiven neigten und häufig einer zusätzlichen topischen Therapie bedurften . Wir haben keine schweren Nebenwirkungen in den hier ausgewerteten 48 Patientenjahren festgestellt . Dupilumab erwies sich als sichere und effiziente Therapie für die atopische Dermatitis in der dermatologischen Praxis .\n",
        "Photodermatoses are sun-related inflammatory skin diseases . They usually require phototesting in diagnosis . However , fewer and fewer medical centers in France are equipped with photobiological equipment . The main purpose was to evaluate the relevance of phototesting in photodermatosis diagnosis . The second goal was to study the proportions of the different kinds of photodermatosis found in this particular study . This study was descriptive , retrospective , and mono-centric . It was based on 100 consecutive patients , who have been phototested in a French University Hospital from 2014 to 2018 . Phototesting included determination of the minimal erythematous dose ( MED means minimal erythematous dose ) , UVA and UVB phototests , and photopatch testing . The use of phototesting led to 60 % of photodermatosis diagnosis and formally eliminated the latter in 13 % of the cases . The diagnosis remained undetermined in 27 % of the cases . Nineteen cases of polymorphous light eruption ( PLE means polymorphous light eruption ) , 14 cases of photocontact dermatitis ( PCD means photocontact dermatitis ) , 10 cases of solar urticaria , 8 cases of photo-aggravated atopic eczema , 5 cases of chronic actinic dermatitis , and 2 cases of systemic photosensitization were diagnosed . The allergens involved in PCD means photocontact dermatitis were topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID means non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) in 9 cases , sunscreens in 3 cases , and fragrance in 2 cases . The average amount of time between the first symptoms and actual phototesting was about 7,5 years . This study confirms phototesting is truly useful . PLE means polymorphous light eruption was the most common form of photodermatosis , followed by PCD means photocontact dermatitis and solar urticaria . As photodermatosis could imply severe diseases sometimes requiring hospitalization , it is critical to maintain this expertise .\n",
        "In the therapeutic arsenal to treat moderate to severe psoriasis , the new agents are secukinumab and ustekinumab , which are fully human monoclonal antibodies , directed against IL-17A and IL-12/23 , respectively , which have been shown to be effective and safe in several studies . Their side effects are rare , and the most frequently reported side effects were infection , especially nasopharyngitis , headache , pruritus , high blood pressure , and low back pain . Unlike the side effects , the paradoxical reaction can be defined by the appearance or exacerbation of a pathological condition that usually responds to a certain class of drug . The appearance of this reaction in patients using anti-interleukins is poorly described ; however , as they are new drugs , they may be more common than the literature reports . We describe a case of a paradoxical reaction , with the appearance of atopic dermatitis , after using secukinumab to treat psoriasis .\n",
        "Network meta-analyses ( NMAs means Network meta-analyses ) simultaneously estimate the effects of multiple possible treatment options for a given clinical presentation . For allergists to benefit optimally from NMAs means Network meta-analyses , they must understand the process and be able to interpret the results . Through a worked example published in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology , we summarize how to identify credible NMAs means Network meta-analyses and interpret them with a focus on recent innovations in the GRADE approach ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ) . NMAs means Network meta-analyses build on traditional systematic reviews and meta-analyses that consider only direct paired comparisons by including indirect evidence , thus allowing the simultaneous assessment of the relative effect of all pairs of competing alternatives . Our framework informs clinicians of how to identify credible NMAs means Network meta-analyses and address the certainty of the evidence . Trustworthy NMAs means Network meta-analyses fill a critical gap in providing key inferences using direct and indirect evidence to inform clinical decision making when faced with more than two competing courses of treatment options . This document will help allergists to identify trustworthy NMAs means Network meta-analyses to enhance patient care .\n",
        "Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA means bisphenol A ) and phthalates could trigger immune response . Few studies have investigated the association between prenatal BPA means bisphenol A and phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP exposure and atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in infants . We aimed to clarify the joint association of prenatal exposure to BPA means bisphenol A and phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP metabolites with AD means atopic dermatitis incidence in 6-month-old infants . We included 413 mother-child pairs from the Mothers and Children 's Environmental Health ( MOCEH means Mothers and Children's Environmental Health ) in a prospective birth cohort study . Maternal urinary BPA means bisphenol A , mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP ( MEHHP means mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate ) , mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP ( MEOHP means mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate ) , and mono-n-butyl phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP ( MnBP means mono-n-butyl phthalate ) concentrations were measured during early and late pregnancy . We applied the Bayesian kernel machine regression ( BKMR means Bayesian kernel machine regression ) with probit regression to estimate the association of BPA means bisphenol A and phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP metabolites with AD means atopic dermatitis incidence after adjusting for potential confounders . Individual association was estimated by differences in predicted probabilities comparing each individual chemical concentration at 75th versus 25th percentiles , while other chemicals were set at their median . Overall joint effect was estimated by differences in predicted probabilities comparing all chemical concentrations at 75th versus 25th percentiles . Individual effect of MEHHP means mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate in late pregnancy was strongly associated with incident AD means atopic dermatitis [ Difference : 0.244 ( 95 % credible interval : -0.066 , 0.554 ) ] in the model including both early and late exposures . Furthermore , we confirmed overall joint association of urinary BPA means bisphenol A and phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP metabolites during pregnancy with a higher risk of AD means atopic dermatitis [ 0.347 ( 0.168 , 0.526 ) for late pregnancy exposure , and 0.307 ( 0.094 , 0.521 ) for both early and late pregnancy ] . Additionally , the joint association was more prominent among girls than that in boys . The joint association of prenatal exposure to BPA means bisphenol A and phthalates could be associated with the incident AD means atopic dermatitis in 6-month-old infants . Further studies are needed to confirm the synergistic effect of BPA means bisphenol A and phthalate means phthalate (MEOHP exposures on AD means atopic dermatitis in children .\n",
        "Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus ( LSA means Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus ) is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disease . To evaluate the characteristics of paediatric LSA means Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus patients in Turkey . Data for patients aged & lt;18 years who were diagnosed with LSA means Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus by a paediatric dermatologist were retrospectively reviewed . Patient demographic characteristics , clinical features , disease duration , the vitamin D level , accompanying diseases , presence of atopy , therapeutic approach and treatment response were recorded . The study included 38 patients , of whom 35 ( 92.1 % ) were female and 3 ( 7.9 % ) were male . Mean age at onset of disease was 6.4 ± 3.3 years in females versus 3.1 ± 2.6 years in males . Mean diagnostic delay was 20.6 ± 28.9 months in females and 2 ± 1.7 months in males . In 28 ( 80 % ) patients the time from onset of lesions to diagnosis was ≥3 months . The majority ( 76.3 % ) of the patients were asymptomatic , whereas five had itching , two had itching and burning , and two had pain . Among the females , 12 ( 34.3 % ) and 23 ( 65.7 % ) presented with isolated extragenital and anogenital involvement + extragenital lesions , respectively . All three males had isolated extragenital involvement . The most commonly recommended treatments were topical calcineurin inhibitors and calcipotriol/betamethasone ointment . Accompanying diseases were as follows : alopecia areata ( n = 2 ) ; atopic dermatitis ( n = 2 ) ; vitiligo ( n = 2 ) ; ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( n = 1 ) ; Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( n = 1 ) . Among the 28 patients whose vitamin D level was measured , 24 ( 85.7 % ) had vitamin D deficiency . LSA means Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus can be asymptomatic in the majority of affected children . Diagnostic delay was noted in 80 % of the study 's LSA means Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus patients , highlighting the lack of awareness of the condition among parents and clinicians .\n",
        "Immune responses were reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis . However , previous studies of an association between allergic or autoimmune diseases and endometriosis have reported inconsistent results . We investigated the association between allergic or autoimmune diseases and the incidence of endometriosis . Using a large-scale health insurance claims database in Japan , we identified patients with endometriosis diagnosed between April 2011 and August 2018 . For each case , we identified up to four controls with the same age and registration month . Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the incidence rate ratio ( IRR means incidence rate ratio ) of endometriosis in women with allergic diseases ( asthma , allergic rhinitis , urticaria , atopic dermatitis , allergic conjunctivitis , and type 1 allergies combined ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , and rheumatoid arthritis compared with women without these diseases . We identified 30 516 cases with endometriosis and 120 976 control participants . Mean age at registration was 30 years . There were significant positive associations between type 1 allergy and endometriosis ( IRR means incidence rate ratio , 1.10 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.06 - 1.13 ) and between rheumatoid arthritis and endometriosis ( IRR means incidence rate ratio , 1.31 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.05 - 1.64 ) . Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was not associated with increased incidence of endometriosis . Among the different allergic diseases , allergic rhinitis , urticaria , and allergic conjunctivitis were associated with the increased incidence . Several allergic diseases were associated with an increased incidence of endometriosis . A higher incidence was also observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . Further studies are warranted to elucidate the influence of immune responses on the development of endometriosis .\n",
        "Loss-of-function mutations of filaggrin ( FLG means filaggrin ) gene ( FLG means filaggrin ) are the strongest known genetic risk factor for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . It is still debatable how FLG means filaggrin gene mutations and the resulting abnormal amount of FLG means filaggrin protein contribute to skin barrier function and symptoms of AD means atopic dermatitis . In this study , we examined the effects of loss-of-function mutations of FLG means filaggrin gene on the severity of skin lesions and skin barrier function in 55 patients with AD means atopic dermatitis by evaluating eight patients with AD means atopic dermatitis with FLG means filaggrin gene mutations and 47 patients with AD means atopic dermatitis without mutations . The results showed that the FLG means filaggrin gene mutation did not affect the duration of AD means atopic dermatitis , severity of AD means atopic dermatitis , degree of local inflammatory symptoms , skin water content and trans-epidermal water loss of the lesions . Next , in these eight mutation carriers and the 47 non-carriers , stratum corneum was collected from the three site of skin lesions using tape-stripping method , and the amounts of FLG means filaggrin protein and total amino acid contained in the stratum corneum was measured to investigate the effect of the FLG means filaggrin gene mutation on the amount of FLG means filaggrin gene product in the local lesion . FLG means filaggrin abnormalities had little effect on FLG means filaggrin protein and total amino acid content in the stratum corneum in the lesional skin . The amount of the FLG means filaggrin products , especially amino acids derived from FLG means filaggrin , in the stratum corneum of AD means atopic dermatitis lesional skin is influenced by development of dermatitis . The results obtained from this study supports that the activation of Th2-dominant inflammatory cells , together with FLG means filaggrin abnormality , plays a role in suppressing the production of FLG means filaggrin in skin lesions .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin disease that can affect both children and adults . It is a chronic disease with recurrent , highly pruritic eczematous lesions . Topical treatment with anti-inflammatory agents is the mainstay of treatment for atopic dermatitis , either in a reactive or proactive approach according to severity of the disease and always in combination with daily application of an emollient cream . Several studies have shown that proactive therapy with either topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors is significantly superior at reducing the number of flares and increasing the interval between flares compared with reactive therapy in patients with moderate and severe disease . The risk of side effects is considered low , and there seem to be no extra economic costs related to this treatment approach . Proactive therapy is an advisable treatment option for patients with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis to gain prolonged disease control ; however , long-term safety data and data on when to stop do not yet exist .\n",
        "Information on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) varies greatly , and so far , only a few studies describe the healthcare of patients with AD means atopic dermatitis in Germany . The aim of the study is to describe the prevalence and medications of people with AD means atopic dermatitis in Germany . Health insurance data for the year 2019 were examined . Prevalence rates , the severity of disease , comorbidities and pharmaceutical supply were analyzed . Insured persons with AD means atopic dermatitis were identified with at least one outpatient or inpatient International Classification Code of Diseases ( L20 ) . In 2019 , 4.21 % [ 95 % CI 4.21 - 4.22 % ] of insured persons had AD means atopic dermatitis ( 3.6 million ) . Women were affected slightly more frequently than men ( 4.74 % [ 95 % CI 4.73 - 4.74 % ] and 3.64 % [ 95 % CI 3.64 - 3.65 % ] ) . Adolescents and children under the age of 15 had the highest prevalence of AD means atopic dermatitis compared to other age groups ( 9.44 % [ 95 % CI 9.42 - 9.46 % ] ) . Majority of the insured persons with AD means atopic dermatitis were affected by a mild to moderate form of the disease . The most common co-morbidity was infections of the skin ( RR 5.00 [ 95 % CI 4.97 - 5.02 % ] ) . Some patients were treated by a dermatologist , while others by a general practitioner , 39.10 % and 36.74 % , respectively . Of the anti-inflammatory drugs , systemic glucocorticosteroids preparations were used most frequently and were most frequently prescribed by the general practitioner . With a total of 42,841 prescriptions ( 1.53 % ) , methotrexate ( third-line treatment option ) was prescribed more frequently than ciclosporin with 19,628 prescriptions ( 0.70 % ) or azathioprine with 25,696 prescriptions ( 0.92 % ) . Ciclosporin ( first-line treatment option ) was prescribed much more frequently by a dermatologist ( 44.00 % versus 14.32 % by general practitioner ) . The biological dupilumab was prescribed 30,801 times ( 1,10 % ) and was also primarily prescribed by a dermatologist ( 66.67 % ) . The present results reveal that a specialist treats approximately one-third of the patients with AD means atopic dermatitis and that there is still a drug undersupply in some cases , especially concerning innovative drugs .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions and intense pruritus . AD means Atopic dermatitis patients are known to face a considerable disease burden , including physical and emotional limitations . There is still limited knowledge about daily implications in education and occupation . We describe disease social stigmatization by measuring bullying and self-isolation in students and professional discrimination in workers . Overall loss of productivity , either at school and at the workplace , was quantified as the sum of absenteeism ( number of days AD means Atopic dermatitis sick leave ) and presenteeism ( number of days with decreased focus and functionality ) . An on-line web survey was sent to 3235 random recipients and 401 met the inclusion criteria ( self-reporting AD means Atopic dermatitis and ≥12 yo ) . The survey domains included daily limitations , QoL , feelings and relationships , together with specific questions about bullying , discrimination and loss of productivity . AD means Atopic dermatitis negatively affected QoL in 51.6 % of respondents , whereas 68.8 % considered AD means Atopic dermatitis as a real limit to daily routine . More in detail , 39.3 % of students were victims of bullying and 33.9 % of workers felt discriminated because of AD means Atopic dermatitis . On average , absenteeism in students was for 17.1 days/year means days/year ( presenteeism : 19.5 days/year means days/year ) , whereas in workers , the estimate was 10.9 days/year means days/year ( presenteeism : 13.1 days/year means days/year ) . Absenteeism and presenteeism were more pronounced in bullied/discriminated subjects . AD means Atopic dermatitis multidimensional implications deeply affect and undermine personal and professional fulfillments . Our results contribute to a better understanding of what living with AD means Atopic dermatitis means .\n",
        "Staphylococci are important members of the human skin microbiome . Many staphylococcal species and strains are commensals of the healthy skin microbiota , while few play essential roles in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis . To study the involvement of staphylococci in health and disease , it is essential to determine staphylococcal populations in skin samples beyond the genus and species level . Culture-independent approaches such as amplicon next-generation sequencing ( NGS means next-generation sequencing ) are time- and cost-effective options . However , their suitability depends on the power of resolution . Here we compare three amplicon NGS means next-generation sequencing schemes that rely on different targets within the genes tuf and rpsK , designated tuf1 , tuf2 and rpsK schemes . The schemes were tested on mock communities and on human skin samples . To obtain skin samples and build mock communities , skin swab samples of healthy volunteers were taken . In total , 254 staphylococcal strains were isolated and identified to the species level by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry . A subset of ten strains belonging to different staphylococcal species were genome-sequenced . Two mock communities with nine and eighteen strains , respectively , as well as eight randomly selected skin samples were analysed with the three amplicon NGS means next-generation sequencing methods . Our results imply that all three methods are suitable for species-level determination of staphylococcal populations . However , the novel tuf2-NGS scheme was superior in resolution power . It unambiguously allowed identification of Staphylococcus saccharolyticus and distinguish phylogenetically distinct clusters of Staphylococcus epidermidis . Powerful amplicon NGS means next-generation sequencing approaches for the detection and relative quantification of staphylococci in human samples exist that can resolve populations to the species and , to some extent , to the subspecies level . Our study highlights strengths , weaknesses and pitfalls of three currently available amplicon NGS means next-generation sequencing approaches to determine staphylococcal populations . Applied to the analysis of healthy and diseased skin , these approaches can be useful to attribute host-beneficial and -detrimental roles to skin-resident staphylococcal species and subspecies .\n",
        "Previous studies have found conflicting results about the association of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) with hypertension . To determine whether AD means atopic dermatitis and AD means atopic dermatitis severity are associated with hypertension . A systematic review was performed of published studies in Ovid MEDLINE , Embase , Scopus , Web of Science , and GREAT means Global Resource for EczemA Trials ( Global Resource for EczemA Trials ) databases . At least two reviewers conducted title/abstract , full-text review and data extraction . Quality of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale . Fifty-one studies met the inclusion criteria and 19 had sufficient data for meta-analysis . AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with higher odds of hypertension compared with healthy controls [ increased in nine of 16 studies ; pooled prevalence 16·4 % vs. 13·8 % ; random-effects regression , pooled unadjusted odds ratio ( OR means odds ratio ) 1·16 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI means confidence interval ) 1·04 - 1·30 ] , but lower odds of hypertension compared with psoriasis [ decreased in five of eight studies ; 15·4 % vs. 24·8 % ( OR means odds ratio 0·53 , 95 % CI means confidence interval 0·37 - 0·76 ) ] . In particular , moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with hypertension compared with healthy controls [ increased in four of six studies ; 24·9 % vs. 14·7 % ( OR means odds ratio 2·33 , 95 % CI means confidence interval 1·10 - 4·94 ) ] . Hypertension was commonly reported as an adverse event secondary to AD means atopic dermatitis treatments , particularly systemic ciclosporin A. Limitations include lack of longitudinal studies or individual-level data , and potential confounding . AD means atopic dermatitis , particularly moderate-to-severe disease , was associated with increased hypertension compared with healthy controls , but with lower odds than for psoriasis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a condition affecting 30 million persons in the United States . AD means Atopic dermatitis patients are heavily infected with Staphylococcus aureus on the skin . A particularly severe form of AD means Atopic dermatitis is eczema herpeticum ( ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum ) , where the patients ' AD means Atopic dermatitis is complicated by S. aureus and herpes simplex virus ( HSV means herpes simplex virus ) infection . This study examined the S. aureus strains from 15 ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum patients , provided blinded , and showed a high association of ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum with strains that produce toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 ( TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 ; 73 % ) compared to 10 % production by typical AD means Atopic dermatitis isolates from patients without EH and those from another unrelated condition , cystic fibrosis . The ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum isolates produced the superantigens associated with TSS ( TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxins A , B , and C ) . This association may in part explain the potential severity of ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum . We also examined the effect of TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and HSV-1 on human epithelial cells and keratinocytes . TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 used CD40 as its receptor on epithelial cells , and HSV-1 either directly or indirectly interacted with CD40 . The consequence of these interactions was chemokine production , which is capable of causing harmful inflammation , with epidermal/keratinocyte barrier disruption . Human epithelial cells treated first with TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and then HSV-1 resulted in enhanced chemokine production . Finally , we showed that TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 modestly increased HSV-1 replication but did not increase viral plaque size . Our data suggest that ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum is associated with production of the major TSS-associated superantigens , together with HSV means herpes simplex virus reactivation . The superantigens plus HSV means herpes simplex virus may damage the skin barrier by causing harmful inflammation , thereby leading to increased symptoms . < b > IMPORTANCE</b > Atopic dermatitis ( eczema , AD means Atopic dermatitis ) with concurrent herpes simplex virus infection ( eczema herpeticum , ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum ) is a severe form of AD means Atopic dermatitis . We show that ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum patients are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus that primarily produces the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 ( TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 ) ; however , significantly but to a lesser extent the superantigens staphylococcal enterotoxins A , B , and C are also represented in ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum . Our studies showed that TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 uses the immune costimulatory molecule CD40 as its epithelial cell receptor . Herpes simplex virus ( HSV means herpes simplex virus ) also interacted directly or indirectly with CD40 on epithelial cells . Treatment of epithelial cells with TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and then HSV-1 resulted in enhanced chemokine production . We propose that this combination of exposures ( TSST-1 means toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and then HSV means herpes simplex virus ) leads to opening of epithelial and skin barriers to facilitate potentially serious ADEH means AD is eczema herpeticum .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) mostly develops in early childhood and tends to resolve with age . However , its time course in severity before and after adolescence varies widely among patients . To investigate the course of disease severity from birth to 19 years old of adult patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis , we conducted a nationwide Web-based survey of 3090 Japanese adult subjects diagnosed with AD means Atopic dermatitis , using a questionnaire to choose a pattern that most resembled their own out of 10 courses of AD means Atopic dermatitis severity . Patients in the 20s and 30s age groups tended to choose the option \" gradually improved \" or \" improved by the age of 12 \" , but patients in the 40s or older age group tended to choose the option \" aggravation between the age of 12 and 19 \" . Those who chose \" AD means Atopic dermatitis development at age 20 or older \" increased as the generation was older . This survey revealed that the time course of AD means Atopic dermatitis severity from birth to 19 years old varies depending on the generation targeted in this study . It is presumed that the acquired factors affecting the natural history of AD means Atopic dermatitis have changed over the past 50 years in Japan .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disorder . Though corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy , the Janus kinase inhibitor abrocitinib has shown promise in recent clinical trials for the treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis . To assess the overall efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in moderate to severe AD means Atopic dermatitis . All randomized controlled trials ( RCTs means randomized controlled trials ) evaluating the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in moderate to severe AD means Atopic dermatitis were included in the meta-analysis . The pooled analysis revealed a significant proportion of patients achieving Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment ) response ( RR = 3.52 , 95 % CI ; 2.78 - 4.46 , < i > p</i > & lt ; .00001 ) , Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) response ( RR = 3.35 , 95 % CI ; 2.54 - 4.41 , < i > p</i > & lt ; .00001 ) , and Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Score ( PP-NRS means Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Score ) response ( RR = 2.54,95 % CI ; 1.95 - 3.30 , < i > p</i > & lt ; .00001 ) in abrocitinib arm compared to the placebo arm . Moreover , the pooled analysis also suggested that treatment-emergent adverse events ( TAEs means treatment-emergent adverse events ) were relatively higher with abrocitinib than placebo ( R.R. = 1.17 ; 95 % CI ; 1.06 - 1.29 , < i > p</i > = .002 ) . This meta-analysis showed that abrocitinib had a significant beneficial effect and tolerable adverse effect profile in patients of AD means Atopic dermatitis . Dose regimens of 200 and 100 mg seemed to have similar benefits . However , long-term trials are needed for corroboration . Key pointsAbrocitinib is emerging as a potential treatment option for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis . The pooled analysis from 4 RCTs means randomized controlled trials demonstrated significant effectiveness of abrocitinib in both physician and patient-reported outcomes like IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment , EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index , and PP-NRS means Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Score . The drug was also well-tolerated across the trials . The number needed to treat ( NNT means number needed to treat ) for all efficacy outcomes was low suggesting clinically desirable benefits with the use of abrocitinib . < b > Trial registration</b > : Review registration number PROSPERO database : CRD42021255634 .\n",
        "Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus ( FT means Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus ) , knowns as \" Jeolpaemo ( ) \" in Korean traditional medicine , is a perennial plant belonging to the Liliaceae family and has been used to treat symptoms such as cough , sputum formation , and purulent pneumonia . Owing to its effects of lowering heat , removing sputum , and reducing swelling , the plant has also been used as an external prescription medicine to treat inflammation . To analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of FT-ethanol extract means extract (FT-Cl ( FT-Et means FT-ethanol extract ) and FT-chloroform fraction extract means extract (FT-Cl ( FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract ) on 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in vivo and in vitro . The effect of FT-Et means FT-ethanol extract and FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract on AD means atopic dermatitis was observed using an AD-like skin lesion model induced by DNCB in vivo . HaCaT and RBL2H3 cells were used to determine the effects of FT-Et means FT-ethanol extract and FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract in vitro . After inducing AD-like skin lesions in vivo , FT means Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus was topically applied to the skin lesion for 35 days . Epidermal thickness , dermal thickness , scratching behavior , infiltration of inflammatory cells , and expression of skin barrier proteins were measured . TARC , MDC , and IL-4 levels were analyzed using ELISA in HaCaT cells . Beta-hexosaminidase and IL-4 levels were measured in RBL2H3 cells . The expression of filaggrin ( FLG means filaggrin ) , loricrin means LOR), involucrin (INV ( LOR means loricrin ) , involucrin ( INV means involucrin ) , and aquaporin-3(AQP-3 ) was measured by PCR . Phosphorylation of MAPKs was analyzed using Western blot technique . FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract significantly reduced ear swelling , scratching behavior , SCORAD index , epidermal thickness , infiltration of inflammatory cells , and loss of skin barrier proteins . FT-Et means FT-ethanol extract inhibited the infiltration of mast cells and CD8<sup>+</sup > cells and decreased the loss of skin barrier proteins . In TNF-α/IFN-γ-stimulated HaCaT cells , FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract inhibited TRAC , MDC , and IL-4 expression and upregulated the expression of FLG means filaggrin , INV means involucrin , and AQP-3 , whereas FT-Et means FT-ethanol extract inhibited the expression of TRAC and MDC and increased the expression of FLG means filaggrin , INV means involucrin , and AQP-3 at high concentrations . In RBL2H3 , FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract downregulated β-hexosaminidase and IL-4 expression . In addition , FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and p-38 in HaCaT and RBL2H3 cells . Collectively , FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract showed better effect than FT-Et means FT-ethanol extract in vivo and in vitro . These results suggest that a specific component present in FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract acted against AD means atopic dermatitis . Future research should focus on the analysis of components contained in FT-Cl means FT-chloroform fraction extract and the anti-inflammatory effects of the active ingredient .\n",
        "< b > Objective.</b > The association of allergic conjunctivitis ( AC means allergic conjunctivitis ) with rhinitis and/or asthma is poorly understood . The objective of this study was to apply the Consensus Document for Allergic Conjunctivitis ( DECA ) criteria for the classification of AC means allergic conjunctivitis to a population of patients with AC means allergic conjunctivitis to assess the association between the severity and duration of AC means allergic conjunctivitis and rhinitis and/or asthma . < b > Methods.</b > Patients with ocular symptoms of AC means allergic conjunctivitis who participated in the ' Alergológica 2015 ' study were included . The demographics , classification according to the DECA criteria , etiology , and comorbidities were evaluated by age groups ( less or equal than 14 and greater than 14 years ) . < b > Results.</b > A total of 2,914 patients ( age range , 1 - 90 years ) were included in the \" Alergológica 2015 \" study . Of these , 965 patients ( 33.1 % ) were diagnosed with AC means allergic conjunctivitis ( 77.5 % & gt ; 14 years ) . AC means allergic conjunctivitis was classified as severe , moderate , or mild in 1.8 % , 46.4 % , and 51.8 % , respectively ; and as intermittent or persistent in 51.6 % and 48.4 % of the patients . AC means allergic conjunctivitis alone occurred in 4 % of patients . AC means allergic conjunctivitis was mainly associated with rhinitis ( 88.4 % ) , asthma ( 38.2 % ) , food allergy ( 8.3 % ) and atopic dermatitis ( 3.5 % ) . In allergic respiratory disease rhinitis preceded AC means allergic conjunctivitis and asthma developed later . The severity and duration of AC means allergic conjunctivitis was significantly associated with severity and duration of rhinitis ( p less than 0.001 for both age groups ) and asthma ( p less than 0.001 only in adults ) . < b > Conclusions.</b > The application of the new DECA classification for AC means allergic conjunctivitis reveals a direct relationship between AC means allergic conjunctivitis , rhinitis and asthma respect to severity and duration . These relationships suggest that AC means allergic conjunctivitis should be considered an integral part of the \" one airway , one disease \" hypothesis .\n",
        "A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using data from healthy subjects and patients with moderate-to-severe asthma receiving intravenous or subcutaneous dupilumab doses . A total of nine phase I to phase III studies were pooled ( 202 healthy subjects and 1912 patients with asthma including 68 adolescents ) in the model development . The best model was a two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear Michaelis-Menten elimination with first order absorption . The PK means Pharmacokinetics parameter estimates were distribution volume of central compartment 2.76 L , linear elimination rate 0.0418 1/day , and subcutaneous bioavailability 60.9 % . Pharmacokinetics ( PK means Pharmacokinetics ) properties of dupilumab in patients with asthma were determined to be comparable to those of healthy subjects and patients with atopic dermatitis . Only body weight exerts a notable effect explaining between-subject variability in dupilumab PK means Pharmacokinetics , but dose adjustment for weight is not warranted based on results from clinical studies . There is no PK means Pharmacokinetics difference between adolescent and adult patients with asthma after correction for body weight .\n",

        "PD-1 is an immunoregulatory receptor that can bind PD-L1 or PD-L2 expressed on stimulated antigen-presenting cells means cells . In this study , isolated antigen-presenting cells means cells ( macrophages and dendritic cells means cells ) were cultured with IFN-γ , IL-4 , or IL-17A , and the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 was compared by flow cytometry . Strong upregulation of PD-L1 expression was observed on IFN-γ stimulation of both antigen-presenting cells means cells as well as in response to IL-17A stimulation of macrophages compared with the expression in unstimulated controls . In contrast , only stimulation with IL-4 could upregulate PD-L2 expression on both antigen-presenting cells means cells . Therefore , experiments were performed in murine models , including DNFB-induced contact hypersensitivity , calcipotriol-induced atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation , and imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis models , to trigger IFN-γ‒mediated T helper type (Th)1- , IL-4‒mediated Th2- , and IL-17A‒mediated Th17-type responses , respectively . In both Th1- and Th17-type immunity models , changes in ear thickness were more severe in Pd-l1‒deficient mice than in wild-type or Pd-l2‒deficient mice . In the Th2-type immunity model , changes in thickness in Pd-l2‒deficient mice were more severe than that in wild-type or Pd-l1‒deficient mice . Collectively , PD-L1 has predominant roles in Th1 and Th17 type immunity , whereas PD-L2 is involved in Th2-type immunity .\n",
        "The heterogeneity of childhood atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) underscores the need to understand latent phenotypes that may inform risk stratification and disease prognostication . To identify AD means atopic dermatitis trajectories across the first 8 years of life and investigate risk factors associated with each trajectory and their relationships with other comorbidities . Data were collected prospectively from 1152 mother-offspring dyads in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes ( GUSTO means Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes ) cohort from ages 3 months to 8 years . AD means atopic dermatitis was defined based on parent-reported doctor 's diagnosis . An unsupervised machine learning technique was used to determine AD means atopic dermatitis trajectories . Three AD means atopic dermatitis trajectories were identified as follows : early-onset transient ( 6.3 % ) , late-onset persistent ( 6.3 % ) and early-onset persistent ( 2.1 % ) , alongside a no AD/reference group ( 85.2 % ) . Early-onset transient AD means atopic dermatitis was positively associated with male gender , family history of atopy , house dust mite sensitization and some measures of wheezing . Early-onset persistent AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with antenatal/intrapartum antibiotic use , food sensitization and some measures of wheezing . Late-onset persistent AD means atopic dermatitis was associated with a family history of atopy , some measures of house dust mite sensitization and some measures of allergic rhinitis and wheezing . Three AD means atopic dermatitis trajectories were identified in this birth cohort , with different risk factors and prognostic implications . Further work is needed to understand the molecular and immunological origins of these phenotypes .\n",
        "Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG means Bacille Calmette-Guérin ) vaccine could play a role in counteracting the rising prevalence of atopic diseases , through its beneficial off-target effects . We aimed to determine whether neonatal BCG means Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination reduces the incidence of eczema in infants . Randomized controlled trial with 1272 infants allocated to receive BCG-Denmark or no BCG means Bacille Calmette-Guérin at birth . The primary outcome was the 12-month incidence of eczema based on 3-monthly questionnaires . Eczema was also assessed at a 12-month clinic visit . ClinicalTrial.gov : NCT01906853 . The 12-month eczema incidence was 32.2 % in the BCG means Bacille Calmette-Guérin group compared with 36.6 % in the control group ( adjusted risk difference ( aRD means adjusted risk difference ) -4.3 % , 95 % CI -9.9 % to 1.3 % , multiple imputation model ) . In addition , comparing infants in the BCG means Bacille Calmette-Guérin group with the control group , 15.7 % vs. 19.2 % had eczema lesions at the 12-month visit ( aRD means adjusted risk difference -3.5 % , 95 % CI -8.0 % to 1.0 % ) ; 35.7 % vs. 39.0 % reported using topical steroids ( aRD means adjusted risk difference -3.3 , 95 % CI -9.2 to 2.7 ) ; and 7.3 % vs. 10.2 % had severe eczema scores ( aRD means adjusted risk difference -3.0 % , 95 % CI -8.8 % to 2.7 % ) . In 344 high-risk infants ( two atopic parents ) , the 12-month eczema incidence was 35.3 % in the BCG means Bacille Calmette-Guérin group compared with 46.8 % in the control group ( aRD means adjusted risk difference -11.5 % , 95 % CI -21.9 % to -1.2 % ; number needed to treat 8.7 , 95 % CI 4.6 to 83.3 ) . There is insufficient evidence to recommend neonatal BCG means Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination in all infants for the prevention of eczema in the first year of life ; however , a modest beneficial effect was observed among high-risk infants . A single dose of BCG-Denmark soon after birth could reduce the incidence of eczema in infants with two atopic parents .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) can remit as age increases . However , long-term follow-up studies evaluating disease evolution and related factors of persistence of early-onset AD means Atopic dermatitis are sparse . This study aimed to identify factors associated with the persistence of early-onset AD means Atopic dermatitis . In this prospective cohort study , 260 patients with onset of AD means Atopic dermatitis before age two years old were enrolled . Clinical examination was performed and a questionnaire survey completed at enrolment . In addition , the filaggrin gene ( FLG means filaggrin gene ) of all participants was sequenced to identify mutations within this gene . Patients were followed at age six and 12 . The remission rate was 50.8 % at age six and 70.3 % at age 12 . Persistent AD means Atopic dermatitis was associated with a higher SCORAD index at baseline ( p & lt ; 0.001 ) , a family history of asthma ( p = 0.003 ) and food allergen sensitization ( p = 0.033 ) . However , the presence or absence of FLG means filaggrin gene mutation did not show any significant association with persistent AD means Atopic dermatitis . Prognostic factors for persistence of AD means Atopic dermatitis were analysed by logistic regression analysis . Disease severity according to SCORAD index at baseline ( OR : 1.039 ; 95 % CI : 1.018 - 1.059 ; p & lt ; 0.001 ) and family history of asthma ( OR : 3.008 ; 95 % CI : 1.297 - 7.007 ; p = 0.011 ) were risk factors that may predict persistent AD means Atopic dermatitis based on multivariate regression analysis . It is important to stratify early-onset AD means Atopic dermatitis according to severity and investigate family allergic history in order to establish appropriate individual management . Moreover , genetic factors other than FLG means filaggrin gene mutation may play more important roles in persistent early-onset AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema often developed before the first year of life . Nevertheless , when the presentation is atypical or related to infections the diagnostic represents a challenge for the pediatricians . It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for the detection of primary immunodeficiency associated to severe eczema . One of them is the autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome characterized by recurrent skin and respiratory infections , atopic dermatitis , eosinophilia , and high serum IgE concentrations . In this paper , we report a 1 months and 29 days old baby girl diagnosed with hyper-IgE and a skin involvement since birth . La dermatitis atópica es la forma más frecuente de eccema durante el primer año de vida ; sin embargo , cuando la presentación es atípica o se asocia a infecciones , constituye un desafío diagnóstico para el pediatra . Es importante mantener un índice alto de sospecha para detectar inmunodeficiencias primarias asociadas a eccemas graves desde el período neonatal . Un ejemplo de estas es el síndrome de hiperinmunoglobulinemia E ( hiper-IgE means hiperinmunoglobulinemia E ) autosómico dominante . Este cuadro se caracteriza por la presencia de infecciones cutáneas y respiratorias recurrentes , dermatitis atópica , eosinofilia y aumento de IgE. Se reporta el caso clínico de una niña de 1 mes y 29 días con diagnóstico de hiper-IgE means hiperinmunoglobulinemia E con afección cutánea desde el nacimiento .\n",
        "Kallikrein 7 ( KLK7 means Kallikrein 7 ) is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease with established roles in skin diseases like the rare Netherton syndrome , an overdesquamating and inflammatory condition , but also common atopic dermatitis , and a potential drug target for these and possibly other diseases . Nevertheless , tools to determine the active KLK7 means Kallikrein 7 enzyme are not available . Here , a mixed alkyl aryl phosphonate quenched activity-based probe that detects the active KLK7 means Kallikrein 7 was developed and evaluated in vitro . This KLK7-qABP can potentially be used to monitor KLK7 means Kallikrein 7 activity in vivo .\n",
        "Atopic diseases , particularly atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , asthma , and allergic rhinitis ( AR means allergic rhinitis ) share a common pathogenesis of inflammation and barrier dysfunction . Epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT means Epithelial to mesenchymal transition ) is a process where epithelial cells take on a migratory mesenchymal phenotype and is essential for normal tissue repair and signal through multiple inflammatory pathways . However , while links between EMT means Epithelial to mesenchymal transition and both asthma and AR means allergic rhinitis have been demonstrated , as we outline in this mini-review , the literature investigating AD means atopic dermatitis and EMT means Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is far less well-elucidated . Furthermore , current studies on EMT means Epithelial to mesenchymal transition and atopy are mostly animal models or < i > ex vivo</i > studies on cell cultures or tissue biopsies . The literature covered in this mini-review on EMT-related barrier dysfunction as a contributor to AD means atopic dermatitis as well as the related ( perhaps resultant ) atopic diseases indicates a potential for therapeutic targeting and carry treatment implications for topical steroid use and environmental exposure assessments . Further research , particularly < i > in vivo</i > studies , may greatly advance the field and translate into benefit for patients and families .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) , also referred to as atopic eczema , is a long-term inflammatory condition that is characterized by itchy , red , swollen and cracked skin . Accumulating evidence suggests that AD means Atopic dermatitis is caused by genetic factors , environmental exposure and immune system dysfunction ; however , its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear . Current treatment strategies aim to decrease the severity and frequency of flares . Heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 means Heme oxygenase-1 ) is a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-regulated gene that plays crucial roles against stress , inflammation and oxidation , and exerts cytoprotective effects . Previous studies have reported that treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis induces high expression levels of HO-1 means Heme oxygenase-1 and Nrf2 , indicating that HO-1 means Heme oxygenase-1 may play an important role in the treatment of AD means Atopic dermatitis . The present study constructed the recombinant protein , cell-penetrating peptide-HO-1 ( CPP-HO-1 means cell-penetrating peptide-HO-1 ) , which was expressed in < i > Escherichia coli</i > and isolated with a 6xHis-tag using HiTrap His column ( 1 ml ) . AD means Atopic dermatitis was established using 4-dinitrochlorobenzene ( DNCB means 4-dinitrochlorobenzene ) in mice . It was observed that the CPP-HO-1 means cell-penetrating peptide-HO-1 fusion protein decreased the severity of AD means Atopic dermatitis , inhibited scratching in mice and decreased skin inflammation . Taken together , the results of the present study suggested that the CPP-HO-1 means cell-penetrating peptide-HO-1 fusion protein may play a protective role against DNCB-induced AD means Atopic dermatitis in mice .\n",
        "Molluscum contagiosum ( MC means Molluscum contagiosum ) is a benign infection caused by a member of the Poxviridae family , molluscum contagiosum virus ( MCV means molluscum contagiosum virus ) . The contributing factors for MCV means molluscum contagiosum virus infection are different in different populations and study areas . Few studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of cryotherapy in the treatment of MC means Molluscum contagiosum . The study 's objectives were to determine contributing factors and outcome after cryotherapy of MC means Molluscum contagiosum among patients attending a tertiary hospital in Northern Tanzania . A hospital-based cohort study was conducted at the Regional Dermatology Training Centre ( RDTC means Regional Dermatology Training Centre ) from September 2018 to August 2019 , involving all patients clinically diagnosed with MC means Molluscum contagiosum . We used a consecutive sampling method to recruit study participants . We treated all participants with cryotherapy and assessed them after two weeks . Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS means Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ) software version 21 . There were 49 patients with MC means Molluscum contagiosum who agreed to participate in this study with a median age of 8 ( IQR 3 - 22 ) . We found 18.4 % of patients with active atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) had MC means Molluscum contagiosum while those with a history of atopic diseases ( Ad means atopic diseases ) were 32 % , and 22.4 % had a history of using immunosuppressive drugs . The clearance rate of cryotherapy on MC means Molluscum contagiosum lesions was found to be 94 % . Hypopigmentation was the commonest adverse effect . The findings of this study show that AD means atopic dermatitis and immunosuppression may be contributing to MC means Molluscum contagiosum development . Based on the clearance rate results , cryotherapy has shown to be effective and may be used in the treatment of MC means Molluscum contagiosum .\n",
        "Emollients provide an occlusive barrier for dry and atopic skin , retain moisture , protect it from irritants , and form the basis of eczema treatment . A prospective interventional single arm study to evaluate the performance and safety of Epaderm < sup> ® </sup > Cream , an emollient and cleanser containing 25 % ( w/w means w/w) paraffin and 5% ) paraffin and 5 % ( w/w means w/w) paraffin and 5% ) glycerine ( thereafter , an emollient cream ) , in patients with dry skin conditions . The primary outcome measure was participant evaluation of skin moisturisation after treatment with an emollient cream for up to 4 weeks . Secondary outcome measures included : evaluation of skin softness using a questionnaire and of pruritus on a visual analogue scale ( VAS means visual analogue scale ) ; clinician assessment of xerosis using Overall Dry Skin ( ODS means Overall Dry Skin ) score and measurement of skin hydration using a non-invasive device ( MoistureMeterEpiD , Delfin Technologies ) at each visit . Sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyse changes from baseline . A total of 114 participants completed the study . 84.2 % ( 80 out of 95 ) of participants or parents strongly agreed or agreed that the cream improved skin moisturisation at 4 weeks of treatment at the target area ( p&lt;0.0001 ) . 86.3 % of participants agreed that skin softness improved after 4 weeks ( p & lt;0.0001 ) . ODS means Overall Dry Skin score improved from 2.1 ( standard deviation ( SD means standard deviation ) 1.0 ) to 0.7 ( SD means standard deviation 0.8 ) at 4 weeks . Skin hydration at the target area improved from 31.5 ( SD means standard deviation 9.3 ) to 40.5 ( SD means standard deviation 8.3 ) ( p&lt;0.001 ) at 4 weeks . Mean skin itchiness reduced from 38.0 ( SD means standard deviation 25.4 ) to 17.7 ( SD means standard deviation 19.8 ) at 4 weeks ( p&lt;0.0001 ) . Ten ( 8.3 % ) adverse device events ( ADEs means adverse device events ) were reported . The emollient cream was well tolerated and demonstrated significant improvements in patient-reported skin moisturisation and softness as well as in clinical measurement of xerosis and skin hydration across all age groups including infants . The emollient cream can be recommended for dry skin conditions including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease , of which incidence is closely related to exposure to environmental pollutants and allergens . Thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP means Thymic stromal lymphopoietin ) plays an important role in the early stages of atopic dermatitis development by inducing Th2 immune responses . In addition , TSLP means Thymic stromal lymphopoietin regulates activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2 ) , promoting the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis . The aim of this study was to investigate whether celastrol alleviated atopic dermatitis symptoms by regulating TSLP means Thymic stromal lymphopoietin expression and ILC2 stimulation . Celastrol suppressed TSLP means Thymic stromal lymphopoietin production in mouse keratinocyte cells by inhibiting NF-ĸB activation . Topical application of celastrol significantly improved atopic dermatitis symptoms induced by house dust mite ( HDM means house dust mite ) in NC/Nga mice as determined by dermatitis score and histological assessment . Celastrol decreased the levels of TSLP means Thymic stromal lymphopoietin in atopic dermatitis skin lesions of HDM-stimulated NC/Nga mice . Celastrol reduced levels of Th2 cytokines including IL-4 , IL-5 , and IL-13 in atopic dermatitis skin lesions of NC/Nga mice . Further , celastrol significantly reduced ILC2 population in atopic dermatitis skin lesions of NC/Nga mice . These results indicate that topical application of celastrol improved atopic dermatitis symptoms by lowering TSLP means Thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels and concomitant immune responses . Data demonstrated that reduced TSLP means Thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels and associated lower number of ILC2 cells alleviate atopic dermatitis symptoms induced by house dust mite .\n",
        "The application of biologics in clinical practice allows immunological observations under real-life conditions . In a new article in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology , Bakker et al.

        "Pyridoxine ( PN means Pyridoxine ) , one of the vitamers of vitamin B6 , plays an important role in the maintenance of epidermal function and is used to treat acne and rough skin . Clinical studies have revealed that PN means Pyridoxine deficiency causes skin problems such as seborrheic dermatitis and stomatitis . However , the detailed effects of PN means Pyridoxine and its mechanism of action in epidermal function are poorly understood . In this study , we examined the effects of PN means Pyridoxine on epidermal function in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and found that PN means Pyridoxine specifically causes an increase in the expression of profilaggrin mRNA , among marker genes of terminal epidermal differentiation . In addition , PN means Pyridoxine treatment caused an increase in the production of filaggrin protein in a concentration-dependent manner . Treatment with P < sub>2x</sub > purinoceptor antagonists , namely , pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo ( benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid ) tetrasodium salt hydrate and TNP-ATP hydrate , induced an increase in the filaggrin protein levels . Moreover , we showed that elevated filaggrin production induced upon PN means Pyridoxine treatment was suppressed by ATP ( known as P < sub>2x</sub > purinoceptor agonist ) . This study is the first to report that PN means Pyridoxine causes an increase in filaggrin transcription and production , and these results suggest that PN-induced filaggrin production may be a useful target as a daily care component in atopic dermatitis , wherein filaggrin levels are specifically reduced .\n",
        "Shrimp allergy is a growing problem among the European population . TSLP , IL-25 and IL-33 are involved in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases , including asthma and atopic dermatitis , as they activate the Th2-dependent immune response . Thirty-seven patients ( 18 male and 19 female ) with a positive history of symptoms associated with shrimp consumption were selected . All patients had blood samples taken to assess the concentration of allergen-specific IgE ( sIgE means allergen-specific IgE ) to house dust mites ( HDM means house dust mites ) and shrimp ( Singleplex , quantitative method with cut off value & gt ; 0,35 kAU/L ) as well as the level of allergen components using the ImmunoCap ISAC method ( Microarray test , semi-quantitative with cut off value & gt ; 0,3 ISU-E ) . The concentrations of TSLP , IL-25 and IL-33 in the patients ' blood serum was assessed using the ELISA method ( Cusabio ) . Twenty patients with negative allergy history of allergic disease tests were included in the control group . Among the 37 shrimp-allergic patients , ImmunoCap ISAC was identified the presence of sIgE means allergen-specific IgE to the available shrimp allergen components in only 14 cases ( 37.8 % ) . TSLP and IL25 levels were significantly higher in the study group . No statistically significant correlation was found between the concentration of analyzed alarmins and the concentration of sIgE means allergen-specific IgE level to shrimp or HDM means house dust mites between the study and control groups . No statistically significant correlation was found between poly-sensitization occurring in patients and levels of TSLP , IL-25 and IL-33 . In shrimp-allergic patients , the concentrations of TSLP and IL-25 were significantly higher than in the control group ( 1.33 vs. 0.49 and 157 vs. 39.36 , respectively ) . There was no correlation between the concentrations of TSLP , IL-25 and IL-33 and the concentration of sIgE means allergen-specific IgE in the patients or the number of allergen components that the patients were sensitized to .

        "Cera Flava ( CF means Cera Flava ) , a natural extract obtained from beehives , is widely used in dermatological products owing to its wound healing , wrinkle reduction , UV-protective , and skin cell turnover stimulation effects . However , its effect on AD-like skin lesions is unknown . In this study , we used a mouse model of AD to evaluate the effects of CP at the molecular and phenotypic levels . Topical house dust mite ( HDM means house dust mite ) sensitization and challenge were performed on the dorsal skin of NC/Nga mice to induce AD-like cutaneous lesions , phenotypes , and immunologic responses . The topical application of CF means Cera Flava for 6 weeks relieved HDM-induced AD-like phenotypes , as quantified by the dermatitis severity score , scratching frequency , and skin moisture . CP decreased immunoglobulin E , histamine , and thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels . Histopathological analysis showed that CF means Cera Flava decreased epidermal thickening and the number of mast cells . CF means Cera Flava attenuated HDM-induced changes in the expression of skin barrier-related proteins . Furthermore , CF means Cera Flava decreased the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors , including interleukin (<i > IL</i>)<i>-1β , IL-4 , IL-13 , IL-8 , TARC , MDC,</i > and < i > RANTES,</i > in dorsal skin tissue via the TLR2/MyD88/TRAF6/ERK pathway . CF means Cera Flava influences skin barrier function and immune regulation to alleviate AD symptoms . It may therefore be an effective alternative to topical steroids for the treatment of AD .\n",
        "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR means aryl hydrocarbon receptor ) , a ligand-activated transcription factor expressed in all skin cell types , plays a key role in physiological and pathological processes . Several studies have shown that this receptor is involved in the prevention of inflammatory skin diseases , e.g. , psoriasis , atopic dermatitis , representing a potential therapeutic target . We tested the safety profile and the biological activity of NPD-0614 - 13 and NPD-0614 - 24 , two new synthetic AhR means aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands structurally related to the natural agonist FICZ , known to be effective in psoriasis . NPD-0614 - 13 and NPD-0614 - 24 did not alter per se the physiological functions of the different skin cell populations involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases . In human primary keratinocytes stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α or lipopolysaccharide the compounds were able to counteract the altered proliferation and to dampen inflammatory signaling by reducing the activation of p38MAPK , c-Jun , NF-kBp65 , and the release of cytokines . Furthermore , the molecules were tested for their beneficial effects in human epidermal and full-thickness reconstituted skin models of psoriasis . NPD-0614 - 13 and NPD-0614 - 24 recovered the psoriasis skin phenotype exerting pro-differentiating activity and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides . These data provide a rationale for considering NPD-0614 - 13 and NPD-0614 - 24 in the management of psoriasis .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) represents a severe global burden on physical , physiological and mental health . Innate immune cell basophils are essential for provoking allergic inflammation in AD means Atopic dermatitis . However , the roles of novel immunoregulatory cytokine IL-37 in basophils remain elusive . We employed in vitro co-culture of human basophils and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and an in vivo MC903-induced AD means Atopic dermatitis murine model to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of IL-37 . In the in vitro model , IL-37b significantly decreased Der p1-induced thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP means thymic stromal lymphopoietin ) overexpression in HaCaT cells and decreased the expression of TSLP means thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor as well as basophil activation marker CD203c on basophils . IL-37 could also reduce Th2 cytokine IL-4 release from TSLP-primed basophils ex vivo . In the in vivo model , alternative depletion of basophils ameliorated AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms and significantly lowered the Th2 cell and eosinophil populations in the ear and spleen of the mice . Blocking TSLP means thymic stromal lymphopoietin alleviated the AD-like symptoms and reduced the infiltration of basophils in the spleen . In CRISPR/Cas9 human IL-37b knock-in mice or mice with direct treatment by human IL-37b antibody , AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms including ear swelling and itching were significantly alleviated upon MC903 challenge . Notably , IL-37b presence significantly reduced the basophil infiltration in ear lesions . In summary , IL-37b could regulate the TSLP-mediated activation of basophils and reduce the release of IL-4 . The results , therefore , suggest that IL-37 may target TSLP-primed basophils to alleviate AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs means Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ) are nuclear hormone receptors expressed in the skin . Three PPAR isotypes , α ( NRC1C1 ) , β or δ ( NRC1C2 ) and γ ( NRC1C3 ) , have been identified.&amp;nbsp;After activation through ligand binding , PPARs means Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor ( RXR ) , another nuclear hormone receptor , to bind to specific PPAR-responsive elements in regulatory regions of target genes mainly involved in organogenesis , cell proliferation , cell differentiation , inflammation and metabolism of lipids or carbohydrates . Endogenous PPAR ligands are fatty acids and fatty acid metabolites . In past years , much emphasis has been given to PPARα and γ in skin diseases . PPARβ/δ is the least studied PPAR family member in the skin despite its key role in several important pathways regulating inflammation , keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation , metabolism and the oxidative stress response . This review focuses on the role of PPARβ/δ in keratinocytes and its involvement in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . Moreover , the relevance of targeting PPARβ/δ to alleviate skin inflammation is discussed .\n",
        "Tomato seeds contain steroidal saponins called lycoperosides . However , it currently remains unclear whether lycoperosides exert anti-inflammatory or anti-allergic effects . Therefore , we herein investigated the effects of tomato seed extract ( TSE means tomato seed extract ) and lycoperoside H ( LH means lycoperoside H ) in Interleukin (IL)-33 transgenic mice . TSE means tomato seed extract ( 500 mg/kg ) or LH means lycoperoside H ( 10 mg/kg ) was orally administered once a day for 101 days and then evaluated mouse behavior , skin symptoms , and blood and skin inflammatory cytokines . TSE means tomato seed extract slightly suppressed scratching behavior , while TSE means tomato seed extract and LH means lycoperoside H both increased locomotive activity . LH means lycoperoside H also significantly suppressed inflammation scores in the limbs , and TSE means tomato seed extract and LH means lycoperoside H reduced transepidermal water loss . Epidermal hyperplasia and the accumulation of eosinophils and mast cells were decreased by TSE means tomato seed extract and LH means lycoperoside H . Skin Th2/Th1 cytokine ratio and serum IgE concentrations were significantly reduced by TSE means tomato seed extract and LH means lycoperoside H . The present results suggest that the oral administration of LH means lycoperoside H derived from tomato seeds effectively ameliorates the symptoms of atopic dermatitis . PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS : It has been reported that tomato seeds contain steroidal saponins , lycoperosides , though the effects of lycoperosides on anti-inflammatory or anti-allergic have not yet been revealed . In this study , we demonstrated that the oral administration of lycoperoside H derived from tomato seeds suppressed atopic dermatitis symptoms in IL-33 transgenic mice .\n",
        "The extracellular matrix ( ECM means extracellular matrix ) is an integral component of all organs and plays a pivotal role in tissue homeostasis and repair . While the ECM means extracellular matrix was long thought to mostly have passive functions by providing physical stability to tissues , detailed characterization of its physical structure and biochemical properties have uncovered an unprecedented broad spectrum of functions . It is now clear that the ECM means extracellular matrix not only comprises the essential building block of tissues but also actively supports and maintains the dynamic interplay between tissue compartments as well as embedded resident and recruited inflammatory cells in response to pathologic stimuli . On the other hand , certain pathogens such as bacteria and viruses have evolved strategies that exploit ECM means extracellular matrix structures for infection of cells and tissues , and mutations in ECM means extracellular matrix proteins can give rise to a variety of genetic conditions . Here , we review the composition , structure and function of the ECM means extracellular matrix in cutaneous homeostasis , inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis as well as infections as a paradigm for understanding its wider role in human health .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is one of the most frequent chronic and inflammatory skin condition . AD means Atopic dermatitis is characterized by damaged epidermal barrier , xerosis and pruritus of eczematous skin lesions which tend to flare . The duration and frequency of exacerbation of AD means Atopic dermatitis symptoms markedly affects the quality of patient life . AD means Atopic dermatitis results from the interplay between host genetics , immunity , and environmental factors , however the detailed pathogenesis of this disease is still not entirely cleared . Furthermore , disturbances of the skin microbiota and skin functional impairment predispose to secondary skin infections . Staphylococcus aureus colonizes skin and mucous membranes of 20 to 80 % of healthy individuals and of 90 % of patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis in whom this bacterium is accounted as an important AD means Atopic dermatitis exacerbating factor . It is also proven , that S. aureus nasal carriage significantly increases the risk for self-transmission and endogenous infection . In the current study the presence of S. aureus either in nasal vestibule and on lesioned skin of 64 patients with AD means Atopic dermatitis enrolled in 10-year autovaccination program was determined . The genetic relatedness of 86 S. aureus isolated from patients nose and skin using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis ( PFGE means Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis ) and antimicrobial susceptibility of all strains to methicillin , erythromycin , clindamycin , mupirocin , gentamicin , amikacin , tetracycline , chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole was also evaluated . In total 23 PFGE means Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis genotypes and 24 unique patterns were distinguished . 34 patients were S. aureus nasal carriers . Simultaneous presence of S. aureus in nose and on affected skin was found in 16 carriers colonized by indistinguishable or potentially related S. aureus vs 2 carriers colonized with non-related S. aureus in nasal vestibule and on skin . 4 isolates were methicillin resistant ( MRSA means methicillin resistant ) among which 3 showed constitutive MLSB resistance phenotype and remaining one was resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol . In 4 isolates inducible MLSB resistance phenotype was found , one of them was additionally resistant to tetracycline . 7 S. aureus were mupirocin resistant among them 3 - isolated from one patient , were resistant simultaneously to tetracyclines and chloramphenicol . 7 strains demonstrated resistance to chloramphenicol and susceptibility to all tested antimicrobial agents . The susceptibility to gentamicin , amikacin and cotrimoxazole among all examined S. aureus was confirmed . The obtained results indicated non-clonal structure of S. aureus circulating in AD means Atopic dermatitis patients . PFGE means Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis results showed the clonal-structure of vast majority of S. aureus isolated from nose and skin from nasal carriers what may prove the autoinfection in these patients . All examined patients the moderate or strong severity of AD means Atopic dermatitis was reported . Susceptibility to most antibiotics among isolated strains was also observed .\n",
        "Interleukin-17C ( IL-17C means Interleukin-17C ) is an understudied member of the IL-17 family of cytokines . Its synthesis is induced by both cytokines and pathogenic stimuli in a variety of cell types , most often expressed at mucosal and barrier surfaces . IL-17C means Interleukin-17C expression is dysregulated in a variety of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease , psoriasis , and atopic dermatitis , yet it is protective against bacterial infections of the gut , skin , and lungs . In this review we highlight studies on IL-17C means Interleukin-17C regulation and its function at human mucosal surfaces . Understanding the relationship between IL-17C means Interleukin-17C and autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the mucosa and defining the beneficial and pathogenic functions of the cytokine in inflammatory responses are the first steps in determining the potential for IL-17C means Interleukin-17C as a therapeutic target .\n",
        "In this study , we investigated the changes in global methylation status and its functional relevance in childhood atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Differences in epigenome-scale methylation events in peripheral blood associated with childhood AD means atopic dermatitis were screened using DNA methylation arrays of 24 patients with AD means atopic dermatitis compared with 24 control subjects . Of the 16,840 differentially methylated CpG regions between AD means atopic dermatitis and control subjects , & gt;97 % CpG loci revealed hypomethylation in patients with childhood AD means atopic dermatitis . Among the globally hypomethylated loci , we identified two CpG clusters within the golli-mbp locus of the MBP gene , which was functionally enriched by subnetwork enrichment analysis as an orchestrator among associated genes . The differential hypomethylation of the top-ranked cg24700313 cluster in the golli-mbp locus was validated by pyrosequencing in an independent cohort of 224 children with AD means atopic dermatitis and 44 control subjects . DNA methylation was found to be negatively correlated with disease severity but showed no significant correlation with IgE levels after age adjustment . The multivariate correlation analysis represents a higher score in AD means atopic dermatitis intensity with significantly increased IgE levels and decreased methylation levels in cg27400313 . We concluded that methylation loss in the golli-mbp locus is an epigenetic factor associated with disease severity of childhood AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "IL-33 , a chromatin-associated multifunctional cytokine , is implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , an inflammatory skin disorder characterized by skin barrier dysfunction . IL-33 accumulates in the nuclei of epidermal keratinocytes ( KCs means keratinocytes ) in AD means atopic dermatitis lesions . However , it is unclear whether nuclear IL-33 directly contributes to the pathogenesis of AD means atopic dermatitis . IL-31 , a pruritogenic cytokine primarily produced by T helper type 2 cells , is elevated in AD means atopic dermatitis lesions and promotes AD means atopic dermatitis development by suppressing KC differentiation and inducing itching . In this study , we investigated the involvement of nuclear IL-33 in IL-31‒mediated suppression of KC differentiation . In monolayer cultures and living skin equivalent , IL-31 increased the expression of full-length IL-33 and the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) in the nuclei of human KCs means keratinocytes , which in turn downregulated the expression of differentiation markers . We found that IL-31 and IL-4/IL-13 use very similar mechanisms to inhibit KC differentiation : nuclear IL-33 combines with phosphorylated STAT3 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and functions as a STAT3 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 transcription cofactor , promoting phosphorylated STAT3 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 binding to the FLG promoter to inhibit its transcription ; moreover , the nuclear IL-33/phosphorylated STAT3 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 complex drives the downregulation of keratin 1 and keratin 10 by reducing the availability of the transcription factor RunX1 . Therefore , nuclear IL-33 plays an important role in IL-31‒mediated differentiation suppression by regulating STAT3 means signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation in human KCs means keratinocytes .\n",

Staphylococcus aureus ( SA means Staphylococcus aureus ) has long been associated with exacerbation of AD means Atopic dermatitis . SA means Staphylococcus aureus produces many virulence factors that interact with the human skin and immune system . These superantigens and toxins have been shown to contribute to adhesion , inflammation and skin barrier destruction . Recent advances in genome sequencing techniques have led to a broadened understanding of the multiple ways SA means Staphylococcus aureus interacts with the cutaneous environment in AD means Atopic dermatitis hosts . For example , temporal shifts in the microbiome , specifically in clonal complexes of SA means Staphylococcus aureus , have been identified during AD means Atopic dermatitis flares and remission . Herein , we review mechanisms of interaction between the cutaneous microbiome and SA means Staphylococcus aureus and highlight known differences in SA means Staphylococcus aureus clonal complexes that contribute to AD means Atopic dermatitis pathogenesis . Detailed knowledge of the genetic strains of SA means Staphylococcus aureus and cutaneous dysbiosis is becoming increasingly relevant in paving the way for microbiome-modulating and precision therapies for AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",

Patients diagnosed with AA means areata between January 2011 and December 2018 were identified in IBM MarketScan < sup> ® </sup > Research Databases . Eligible patients had no other hair loss-related disorders and were continuously enrolled with medical and pharmacy benefits at least 12 months before and after AA means areata diagnosis . Descriptive statistics were used to summarize comorbid conditions , treatments related to AA means areata or other autoimmune/inflammatory conditions , and all-cause and AA-specific healthcare costs and resource utilization identified from claims data . A total of 68,121 patients with AA means areata were identified . Mean ( SD means steroids. Mean ) age was 40.3 ( 17.8 ) years and 61.0 % were female . The most common comorbidities included hyperlipidemia ( 22.4 % ) , hypertension ( 21.8 % ) , thyroid disorders ( 13.1 % ) , contact dermatitis or eczema ( 10.8 % ) , depression ( 9.5 % ) , and anxiety ( 8.4 % ) . Comorbid autoimmune diseases included atopic dermatitis ( 2.8 % ) , psoriasis ( 2.1 % ) , chronic urticaria ( 1.5 % ) , and rheumatoid arthritis ( 1.1 % ) . During the 12-month follow-up period , 37,995 patients ( 55.8 % ) were prescribed treatment for their AA means areata or other comorbid autoimmune/inflammatory disease ; 44.9 % of treated patients were prescribed therapy within 7 days of AA means areata diagnosis . Of patients receiving treatment , 80.3 % received topical steroids and 30.0 % received oral steroids . Mean ( SD means steroids.

Patients with AA means areata have a high comorbidity burden and lack of treatment . Current AA means areata treatments , including systemic therapies other than oral steroids , were not frequently utilized in this study population . Healthcare costs incurred by patients with AA means areata went beyond AA-related expenses . Longitudinal data are needed to better understand treatment trajectories and the disease burden in patients with AA means areata .\n",
        "In chronic skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , therapeutic failure due to poor patient adherence to treatment is commonly reported . Therapeutic patient education ( TPE means Therapeutic patient education ) is an approach to improve self-management and adherence . Several studies demonstrated that TPE means Therapeutic patient education programmes have positive effects on disease management resulting in decreased disease severity and improved quality of life in AD means atopic dermatitis patients . Various healthcare professionals ( dermatologists , nurses , psychologists , dieticians ) have been involved . TPE means Therapeutic patient education performed by trained dermatology nurses are highly efficient and improve various health-related outcomes . The aim of this position paper is to analyse the aims , modalities and efficacy of TPE means Therapeutic patient education in AD means atopic dermatitis , to identify specific roles of dermatology nurses , to assess qualification requirements , and to propose practical recommendations . Potential activities of nurses in ongoing and future TPE means Therapeutic patient education programmes for AD means atopic dermatitis patients will be discussed .\n",
        "In atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 means phosphodiesterase 4 ) inhibition reduces proinflammatory mediators and cytokines . Difamilast is a new selective PDE4 means phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor . To demonstrate the superiority of topical difamilast to vehicle in Japanese paediatric patients with AD means atopic dermatitis . This was a phase 3 randomised , double-blind , vehicle-controlled trial . Patients aged 2 - 14 years with an Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA means Investigator Global Assessment ) score of 2 or 3 received difamilast 0·3 % ( n = 83 ) , difamilast 1 % ( n = 85 ) or vehicle ( n = 83 ) ointment twice daily for 4 weeks . The primary endpoint was the success rate in IGA means Investigator Global Assessment score at week 4 ( percentage of patients with IGA means Investigator Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 with improvement by at least 2 grades ) . The success rates in IGA means Investigator Global Assessment score at week 4 were 44·6 % , 47·1 % , and 18·1 % in the difamilast 0·3 % , difamilast 1 % , and vehicle groups , respectively . Both difamilast groups demonstrated significantly higher success rates in IGA means Investigator Global Assessment score versus vehicle at week 4 ( difamilast 0·3 % , P = 0·0005 ; difamilast 1 % , P & lt ; 0·0001 ) . Regarding secondary endpoints , success rates in Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) 50 , EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 and EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index 90 at week 4 were significantly higher in difamilast 0·3 % and 1 % than those in vehicle . EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index score in difamilast 0·3 % and 1 % was significantly reduced compared with that of vehicle at week 1 , and the significant difference between both difamilast and vehicle groups was maintained from week 1 through week 4 . Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate , and no serious events or deaths were reported . Difamilast 0·3 % and 1 % ointments are superior to vehicle and well tolerated in Japanese paediatric patients with AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CARMIL2 cause combined immunodeficiency associated with dermatitis , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD means inflammatory bowel disease ) , and EBV-related smooth muscle tumors . Clinical and immunological characterizations of the disease with long-term follow-up and treatment options have not been previously reported in large cohorts . We sought to determine the clinical and immunological features of CARMIL2 deficiency and long-term efficacy of treatment in controlling different disease manifestations . The presenting phenotypes , long-term outcomes , and treatment responses were evaluated prospectively in 15 CARMIL2-deficient patients , including 13 novel cases . Lymphocyte subpopulations , protein expression , regulatory T ( Treg ) , and circulating T follicular helper ( cT < sub > FH</sub > ) cells were analyzed . Three-dimensional ( 3D ) migration assay was performed to determine T-cell shape . Mean age at disease onset was 38 ± 23 months . Main clinical features were skin manifestations ( n = 14 , 93 % ) , failure to thrive ( n = 10 , 67 % ) , recurrent infections ( n = 10 , 67 % ) , allergic symptoms ( n = 8 , 53 % ) , chronic diarrhea ( n = 4 , 27 % ) , and EBV-related leiomyoma ( n = 2 , 13 % ) . Skin manifestations ranged from atopic and seborrheic dermatitis to psoriasiform rash . Patients had reduced proportions of memory CD4<sup>+</sup > T cells , Treg , and cT < sub > FH</sub > cells . Memory B and NK cells were also decreased . CARMIL2-deficient T cells exhibited reduced T-cell proliferation and cytokine production following CD28 co-stimulation and normal morphology when migrating in a high-density 3D collagen gel matrix . IBD means inflammatory bowel disease was the most severe clinical manifestation , leading to growth retardation , requiring multiple interventional treatments . All patients were alive with a median follow-up of 10.8 years means range: 3-17 years ( range : 3 - 17 years means range: 3-17 years ) . This cohort provides clinical and immunological features and long-term follow-up of different manifestations of CARMIL2 deficiency .\n",
        "Skin prick tests are widely used to diagnose allergic sensitization . The influence of obesity on the skin prick test result has not been clearly established , even though the association between allergic disease and obesity is relatively well known . To determine whether a change in body mass index ( BMI means body mass index ) contributes to skin reactivity to histamine and allergens in a skin prick test , we performed a 2-year follow-up study on Korean children . Skin prick tests for common aeroallergens were performed on elementary school students from Jeju Island , Korea . BMI means body mass index was calculated using weight and height after measuring both , and demographic characteristics were surveyed . The same tests were repeated after 2 years . The sensitization rate increased during the 2 years between tests and the children 's mean BMI means body mass index also increased , along with their age . The wheal sizes induced by < i > Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</i > , < i > Dermatophagoides farinae</i > , Japanese cedar , and histamine were significantly increased during 2 years ; however , only the histamine reaction associated with increased BMI means body mass index had statistical significance . Furthermore , other variables-including the number of sensitized allergens-were not related to histamine skin reactivity . Histamine skin reactivity increased in children over time and some allergens showed increased specific reactions ; however , BMI means body mass index gain is a specific predictor of histamine reactivity . Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of these changes .\n",
        "Chemokines are a group of small proteins which play an important role in leukocyte migration and invasion . They are also involved in the cellular proliferation and migration of tumor cells . Chemokine CCL27 ( cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine , CTACK ) is mainly expressed by keratinocytes of the normal epidermis . It is well known that this chemokine plays an important role in several inflammatory diseases of the skin , such as atopic dermatitis , contact dermatitis , and psoriasis . Moreover , several studies have shown an association between CCL27 expression and a variety of neoplasms including skin cancer . In this chapter , we address the role of chemokine CCL27 in the tumor microenvironment in the most relevant cancers of the skin and other anatomical locations . We also make a brief comment on future perspectives and the potential relation of CCL27 with different immunotherapeutic modalities .\n",
        "The prevalence of cashew nut allergy is increasing . Clinical reaction to cashew nuts may be severe , including anaphylaxis . In this study , we aimed to evaluate the frequency of cashew nut sensitivity in a group of children with food allergy and the clinical features and course of cashew nut allergy . A retrospective chart review was performed on 516 children who presented with food allergy at a pediatric allergy department . Individuals sensitized to cashew nuts were examined . Cashew nut sensitization was detected in 17 ( 64.7 % male ; mean age of symptom onset , 14 months ) of 516 patients with food allergy . Skin symptoms were the most frequent clinical presentation , followed by gastrointestinal symptoms . Overall , 29.4 % of the patients presented with anaphylaxis . All anaphylactic reactions were developed after the first consumption of cashew nuts . Of the cashew nut-sensitized patients , 82.3 % were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis , and all of them had multiple food allergies . During the follow-up , 90 % of the patients who had cashew nut sensitization and co-existing food allergies to cow 's milk and/or hen 's egg developed tolerance to cow 's milk and/or hen 's egg , but none of the patients could tolerate cashew nut ingestion . Cashew nut is a potent allergen , causing severe allergic reactions that persist long term compared with other food allergies . Early onset of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and multiple food allergies are remarkable co-existing conditions in children who have been diagnosed with cashew nut allergy . Pediatricians should be aware of this emerging food allergy .\n",
        "Ceramides are a class of sphingolipid that is the backbone structure for all sphingolipids , such as glycosphingolipids and phosphosphingolipids . While being a minor constituent of cellular membranes , ceramides are the major lipid component ( along with cholesterol , free fatty acid , and other minor components ) of the intercellular spaces of stratum corneum that forms the epidermal permeability barrier . These stratum corneum ceramides consist of unique heterogenous molecular species that have only been identified in terrestrial mammals . Alterations of ceramide molecular profiles are characterized in skin diseases associated with compromised permeability barrier functions , such as atopic dermatitis , psoriasis and xerosis . In addition , hereditary abnormalities of some ichthyoses are associated with an epidermal unique ceramide species , omega-O-acylceramide . Ceramides also serve as lipid modulators to regulate cellular functions , including cell cycle arrest , differentiation , and apoptosis , and it has been demonstrated that changes in ceramide metabolism also cause certain diseases . In addition , ceramide metabolites , sphingoid bases , sphingoid base-1-phosphate and ceramide-1-phosphate are also lipid mediators that regulate cellular functions . In this review article , we describe diverse physiological and pathological roles of ceramides and their metabolites in epidermal permeability barrier function , epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation , immunity , and cutaneous diseases . Finally , we summarize the utilization of ceramides as therapy to treat cutaneous disease .\n",
        "Sleep disturbances are common in patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Considering their relevant burden on health , routine screening of sleep disturbances seems to be very useful in AD means atopic dermatitis adults management . However , few studies have evaluated the association between sleep disturbances and AD means atopic dermatitis in adults and real-life data are lacking . The aim is to assess the effect of treatment with dupilumab on sleep disturbances in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis . Retrospective , multicenter study including patients ( age≥18 yr.s ) with severe atopic dermatitis who were treated with dupilumab for at least 8 months from January 2019 to January 2020 . Patients were evaluated three times : at treatment initiation ( T0 ) and at 4 ( T4 ) and 8 months ( T8 ) from the start of treatment . At each visit disease activity was assessed by severity score ( Eczema Area and Severity Index , EASI ) , patient-reported outcomes ( Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale , NRS , Dermatology Life Quality Index , DLQI , and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , PSQI ) . Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to evaluate the normality distribution , Bartlett 's test for homoscedasticity . Since the assumptions were met , ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to evaluate the mean difference of PSQI , EASI , DLQI and Pruritus NRS between baseline , 4th month and 8th month . In addition , Chi-square for Trend test was performed to evaluate the increasing/decreasing prevalence of poor sleepers . A total of 36 patients ( 15 females and 21 males ) with a mean age of 42.5±14.3 ( range 20 - 67 ) were included in the study . The mean score for PSQI at TO was 9.0 ±3.6 . At week 16 ( T4 ) the mean score for PSQI was 4.92±2.99 and at week 32 ( T8 ) , the mean score for PSQI was 4.3± 3.0 . EASI , NRS pruritus and DLQI significantly improved during follow up ( p&lt;0.001 ) whereas PSQI improved significantly at 16 weeks ( T4 ) but no significant further improvement was observed at 32 weeks . Of the 31 patients ( 86 % ) with baseline PSQI≥5 , 17 (54%)experienced sleep quality improvement during treatment . Overall , we observed a total of 22 patients ( 61.1 % ) having a PSQI & lt;5 at 32 weeks CONCLUSIONS : Our data show effectiveness of Dupilumab in improving sleep disturbances in adult patients with severe AD means atopic dermatitis . However , further studies are required to uPnSdQeIr sctoaunld isf erve as useful evaluating tool .\n",
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 ) pandemic began in December 2019 . While it has not yet ended , COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 has already created transitions in health care , one of which is a decrease in medical use for health-related issues other than COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 infection . Korean soldiers are relatively homogeneous in terms of age and physical condition . They show a similar disease distribution pattern every year and are directly affected by changes in government attempts to control COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 with nonpharmaceutical interventions . This study aimed to identify the changes in patterns of outpatient visits and admissions to military hospitals for a range of disease types during a pandemic . Outpatient attendance and admission data from all military hospitals in South Korea from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed . Only active enlisted soldiers aged 18 - 32 years were included . Outpatient visits where there was a diagnosis of pneumonia , acute upper respiratory tract infection , infectious conjunctivitis , infectious enteritis , asthma , allergic rhinitis , allergic conjunctivitis , atopic dermatitis , urticaria , and fractures were analyzed . Admissions for pneumonia , acute enteritis , and fractures were also analyzed . All outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 for each disease were counted on a weekly basis and compared with the average number of visits over the same period of each year from 2016 to 2019 . The corrected value was calculated by dividing the ratio of total weekly number of outpatient visits or admissions to the corresponding medical department in 2020 to the average in 2016 - 2019 . A total of 5,813,304 cases of outpatient care and 143,022 cases of admission were analyzed . For pneumonia , the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years ( < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) . The results were similar for outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory tract infection and infectious conjunctivitis ( < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) , while the corrected number of outpatient visits for infectious enteritis showed a significant increase in 2020 ( < i > P</i > = 0.005 ) . The corrected number of outpatient visits for asthma in 2020 did not differ from the average of the previous 4 years but the number of visits for the other allergic diseases increased significantly ( < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) . For fractures , the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years ( < i > P</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) . During the COVID-19 means coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic , outpatient visits to military hospitals for respiratory and conjunctival infections and fractures decreased , whereas visits for allergic diseases did not change or increased only slightly . Admissions for pneumonia decreased significantly in 2020 , while those for acute enteritis and fractures also decreased , but showed an increased proportion compared with previous years . These results are important because they illustrate the changing patterns in lifestyle as a result of public encouragement to adopt nonpharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic and their effect on medical needs for both infectious and noninfectious diseases in a select group .\n",
        "Currently , several biologics are used for the treatment of cutaneous pathologies such as atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , psoriasis or skin cancers . The main administration routes are subcutaneous and intravenous injections . However , little is known about antibody penetration through the skin . The aim was to study the transcutaneous penetration of a reduced-size antibody as a single-chain variable fragment ( scFv ) compared to a whole antibody ( Ab means antibody ) and to determine its capacity to neutralize an inflammatory cytokine involved in AD means atopic dermatitis such as human interleukin-4 ( hIL-4 means human interleukin-4 ) . Transcutaneous penetration was evaluated by ex vivo studies on tape-stripped pig ear skin . ScFv and Ab means antibody visualization through the skin was measured by Raman microspectroscopy . In addition , hIL-4 means human interleukin-4 neutralization was studied in vitro using HEK-Blue ™ IL-4/IL-13 cells and normal human keratinocytes ( NHKs means normal human keratinocytes ) . After 24 h of application , analysis by Raman microspectroscopy showed that scFv penetrated into the upper dermis while Ab means antibody remained on the stratum corneum . In addition , the anti-hIL4 scFv showed very efficient and dose-dependent hIL-4 means human interleukin-4 neutralization . Thus , scFv penetrates through to the upper papillary dermis while Ab means antibody mostly remains on the surface , the anti-hIL4 scFv also neutralizes its target effectively suggesting its potential use as topical therapy for AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Geographic tongue ( GT means Geographic tongue ) represents a localized type of psoriasis inversa and its burden of dermatological and oral comorbidities frequently conditions its severity and diagnosis . Currently , no epidemiological studies have evaluated GT means Geographic tongue muco-cutaneous comorbidities . We aimed to study oral and dermatological comorbidities in a large sample of GT means Geographic tongue patients . In this multicenter , cross-sectional study , involving 4 primary referral centers in Italy , we evaluated adult GT means Geographic tongue patients , who were assessed by board certified dermatologists and dentists for 5 months and collected demographics and medical history . GT means Geographic tongue was evaluated using Hume 's classification together with Geographic tongue severity index ( GTASI ) to score its severity . The prevalence of oral and dermatological comorbidities was recorded . In the sample we enrolled 137 GT means Geographic tongue patients ( M/F= 5:1 ) with a mean age of 48,2 ± 14,7 yoa and 33.6 % had GT means Geographic tongue family history . The clinical evaluation found 96 ( 70.1 % ) GT means Geographic tongue type I , 7 ( 5.1 % ) type II , 13 ( 9.5 % ) type IIIa , 19 ( 13.9 % ) type IIIb , 2 ( 1.5 % ) type IV , following Hume 's classification . The mean GTASI score was 23,7 ± 14,2 and the vast majority displayed a severe form of GT means Geographic tongue . Eighty-nine patients had oral comorbidities ( burning mouth syndrome , caries , parulid and lichen planus ) and 80 had dermatological concurrent conditions ( plaque psoriasis , inverse psoriasis and atopic dermatitis ) . In GT means Geographic tongue patients , both dermatological and dental evaluation should be mandatory to identify previously undiagnosed mucocutaneous comorbidities .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a prototypic inflammatory disease that presents with intense itching . The pathophysiology of AD means Atopic dermatitis is multifactorial , involving environmental factors , genetic susceptibility , skin barrier function , and immune responses . A recent understanding of pruritus transmission provides more information about the role of pruritogens in the pathogenesis of AD means Atopic dermatitis . There is evidence that pruritogens are not only responsible for eliciting pruritus , but also interact with immune cells and act as inflammatory mediators , which exacerbate the severity of AD means Atopic dermatitis . In this review , we discuss the interaction between pruritogens and inflammatory molecules and summarize the targeted therapies for AD means Atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Primary care providers ( PCPs means Primary care providers ) , including pediatricians and general practitioners , are often the first to see children with eczema/atopic dermatitis ( AD means eczema/atopic dermatitis ) . Little is known about management of pediatric AD means eczema/atopic dermatitis by PCPs means Primary care providers and adherence to national guidelines . To review existing literature examining management components of pediatric AD means eczema/atopic dermatitis ( topical corticosteroids [ TCS ] , topical calcineurin inhibitors [ TCIs ] , antihistamines , bathing , emollients , and diet ) by PCPs means Primary care providers . PubMed/Medline and Embase . English-language articles dated 2015 to 2020 reporting outcomes addressing management of pediatric AD means eczema/atopic dermatitis by PCPs means Primary care providers . Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts , reviewed full-text articles , extracted relevant data , and evaluated study quality . Disagreements were resolved by a third author . Twenty articles were included . Surveys and national database analyses were the most common methodologies ( n = 7 each ) . PCPs means Primary care providers commonly prescribed TCS but had a preference for low-potency agents , overprescribed nonsedating antihistamines , and avoided TCIs . PCPs means Primary care providers commonly recommended emollients , although this was not universal . Data characterizing nonmedication management were limited . Most studies did not examine individual patient encounters , but rather relied on providers reporting their general behaviors . Provider behavior may vary based on country of practice . Knowledge and management gaps exist among PCPs means Primary care providers in treating pediatric AD means eczema/atopic dermatitis in key areas including knowledge of TCS safety profiles and prescribing of TCIs . The current literature is largely limited to small studies that evaluate prescribing behaviors with limited data characterizing nonmedication management , highlighting the need for future research in this area .\n",
        "Atopic diseases , such as atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) , allergic asthma ( AA means asthma ) , and allergic rhinitis ( AR means allergic rhinitis ) , are increasingly becoming a worldwide issue . This atopic triad originates at an early age and on a multifactorial basis , causing significant discomfort to susceptible individuals . The global case number is now reaching new highs , so exploring immune system regulation and its components is becoming critical . One cytokine , interleukin-32 ( IL-32 ) , is involved in inflammation and regulation of the immune system . It has nine isoforms that show varying degrees of expression , both intracellularly and extracellularly . IL-32 is secreted by immune cells , such as monocytes , macrophages , natural killer cells , and T cells , and by nonimmune cells , including fibroblasts , keratinocytes , and endothelial cells . Its production is regulated and augmented by microorganisms , mitogens , and other cytokines . Early studies demonstrated that IL-32 was an immune regulator that functioned to protect against inflammatory diseases , including AD means atopic dermatitis , AA means asthma , and AR means allergic rhinitis , and proposed a proinflammatory role for IL-32 in immune regulation and symptom exacerbation . However , several later reports suggested that IL-32 is downregulated in inflammatory diseases and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect . This review article focuses on recent findings regarding the detrimental and protective roles of IL-32 in development and management of inflammatory diseases . The exact role of IL-32 in AD means atopic dermatitis , AA means asthma , and AR means allergic rhinitis still remains to be elucidated . Future research should explore new avenues of IL-32 functionality in human inflammatory diseases .\n",
        "Inflammatory skin diseases including atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and psoriasis ( PSO means psoriasis ) are underpinned by dendritic cell (DC)-mediated T cell responses . Currently , the heterogeneous human cutaneous DC population is incompletely characterized , and its contribution to these diseases remains unclear . Here , we performed index-sorted single-cell flow cytometry and RNA sequencing of lesional and nonlesional AD means atopic dermatitis and PSO means psoriasis skin to identify macrophages and all DC subsets , including the newly described mature LAMP3+BIRC3 + DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules ( mregDC ) and CD14 + DC3 . By integrating our indexed data with published skin datasets , we generated a myeloid cell universe of DC and macrophage subsets in healthy and diseased skin . Importantly , we found that CD14 + DC3s increased in PSO means psoriasis lesional skin and co-produced IL1B and IL23A , which are pathological in PSO means psoriasis . Our study comprehensively describes the molecular characteristics of macrophages and DC subsets in AD means atopic dermatitis and PSO means psoriasis at single-cell resolution , and identifies CD14 + DC3s as potential promoters of inflammation in PSO means psoriasis .\n",
        "Although Western medicine and ideas about atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) have become popular in many Asian countries , local beliefs about the disease and its treatment often prevail . The multi-racial background of these countries as well as the influence of the diverse religions ( such as Taoism and Ramadan ) in these regions often lead to diverse belief systems about the causes of AD means atopic dermatitis ( such as the Chi concept , also known as the balance of yin and yang ) and the types of treatment ( e.g. herbal remedies , topical versus concoctions and decoctions ) . In addition , many of the cultural practices are preserved among the southeast Asian minorities residing in the United Kingdom and North America . Eastern treatments typically take a holistic approach to AD means atopic dermatitis and emphasize the psychosomatic component of the disorder . This overview summarizes the difference between Conventional , Complementary , Alternative , and Integrative Medicine in epidemiology , etiology , therapy , and prognosis in children with AD means atopic dermatitis . There are several similarities in genetic and environmental factors in epidemiology and etiology ; however , differences exist in terms of the concept of management . Complementary and alternative medicine , traditional Chinese medicine , and integrative medicine usage are prevalent among the Asian population but are becoming more popular and accepted in Western societies .\n",
        "Following the publication of the above article , an interested reader drew to the authors ' attention that they had mentioned that activated PKCδ phosphorylates IKKβ in order that IKKβ is relocated to the plasma membrane , resulting in the induction of mast cell degranulation ; however , four references the authors had included did not seem to support this statement . The authors have re-examined their paper , and realized that the four references the reader mentioned were indeed cited incorrectly , and wish to rectify this error through revising the third paragraph in the Discussion section , the References section , and an associated figure ( Fig. 6C ) in order to avoid any further misunderstandings on the part of the readership . First , the authors wish to revise the wording of the third and fourth paragraphs of the Discussion , as featured on pp . 1101 - 1102 , to the following ( changed text is indicated in bold ): ' We showed that CRT exerts anti-AD effect through inhibition of the mast cell degranulation in mast cells . Upon IgE/antigen stimulation , the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif ( ITAM means immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif ) region of FcεRI receptor which is on the mast cell surface is phosphorylated and the initial signalling protein kinases Lyn and Syk are recruited to the ITAM means immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif ( 28,29 ) . Then , the activated Lyn and Syk leads to phosphorylation of the transmembrane adaptor linker for activation of T cells ( LAT means linker for activation of T cells ) . Phosphorylated LAT means linker for activation of T cells which is a scaffold for multimolecular signalling complexes and activates PLCγ through phosphorylation . The activated PLCγ hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol biphosphate ( PIP2 ) to generate second signalling molecules IP3 and DAG , which activate PKCs including PKCδ to induce the mast cell degranulation ( 30,31 ) . On the other hand , cross-linking of FcεRI also activates IKKβ , which moves to the lipid raft fractions and phosphorylates synaptosomal-associated protein 23 ( SNAP-23 means synaptosomal-associated protein 23 ) leading to degranulation ( 7 ) . Since PKCδ phosphorylates IKKα , but not IKKβ ( 32 ) , it is not likely that two signalling pathways are directly connected . In this study , novel function of CRT on phosphorylations of Lyn/Syk kinases in mast cells is elucidated for the first time . Furthermore , it is likely that this inhibitory effect of CRT on Lyn/Syk kinases negatively affected activities of their downstream signalling molecules including PLCγ , PKCδ , and IKKβ , which leads to decrease in mast cell degranulation by CRT treatment . Besides the inhibitory effect of CRT on mast cell degranulation , here we provide additional evidence that CRT exerts anti-AD effects through inactivation of MAPK and NF‑κB. It has been reported that CRT regulates the activities of MAPK and NF‑κB in various cell types . In rhabdomyosarcoma , hepatoma , and breast carcinoma , CRT activates MAPK p38/JNK and suppresses ERK1/2 , followed by caspase-independent apoptosis ( 10,33,34 ) . In chronic myeloid leukaemia cells , CRT enhances TNF‑α-induced apoptosis through the activation of MAPK p38 ( 35 ) . In smooth muscle cells , CRT exerts anti-migration/invasion effect as it inhibits TNF‑α/NF‑κB signalling pathway ( 36 ) . ' Secondly , the authors wish to make the following changes to the Reference list : New references 30 - 32 have been inserted to the list , as follows : 30 . Ozawa K , Szallasi Z , Kazanietz MG , Blumberg PM , Mischak H , Mushinski JF and Beaven MA : Ca < sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca < sup>2+</sup>-independent isozymes of protein kinase C mediate exocytosis in antigen-stimulated rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cell .

        "Chitinase-3-like-1 ( CHI3L1 means Chitinase-3-like-1 ) is known to induce inflammation in the progression of allergic diseases . Previous our studies revealed that 2-({3-[2-(1-cyclohexen-1-yl)ethyl]-6,7-dimethoxy-4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-quinazolinyl}sulfanyl)-N-(4-ethylphenyl)butanamide ( K284 - 6111 ; K284 ) , the CHI3L1 means Chitinase-3-like-1 inhibiting compound , has the anti-inflammatory effect on neuroinflammation . In this study , we investigated that K284 treatment could inhibit the development of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . To identify the effect of K284 , we used phthalic anhydride ( 5 % PA)-induced AD means atopic dermatitis animal model and < i > in vitro</i > reconstructed human skin model . We analyzed the expression of AD-related cytokine mediators and NF-κB signaling by Western blotting , ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR . Histological analysis showed that K284 treatment suppressed PA-induced epidermal thickening and infiltration of mast cells . K284 treatment also reduced PA-induced release of inflammatory cytokines . In addition , K284 treatment inhibited the expression of NF-κB activity in PA-treated skin tissues and TNF-α and IFN-γ-treated HaCaT cells . Protein-association network analysis indicated that CHI3L1 means Chitinase-3-like-1 is associated with lactoferrin ( LTF means lactoferrin ) . LTF means lactoferrin was elevated in PA-treated skin tissues and TNF-α and IFN-γ-induced HaCaT cells . However , this expression was reduced by K284 treatment . Knockdown of LTF means lactoferrin decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in TNF-α and IFN-γ-induced HaCaT cells . Moreover , anti-LTF antibody treatment alleviated AD means atopic dermatitis development in PA-induced AD means atopic dermatitis model . Our data demonstrate that CHI3L1 means Chitinase-3-like-1 targeting K284 reduces AD-like skin inflammation and K284 could be a promising therapeutic agent for AD means atopic dermatitis by inhibition of LTF means lactoferrin expression .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a multifaceted , chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease that affects people of all ages . It is characterized by chronic eczema , constant pruritus , and severe discomfort . AD means Atopic dermatitis often progresses from mild annoyance to intractable pruritic inflammatory lesions associated with exacerbated skin sensitivity . The T helper-2 ( Th2 means T helper-2 ) response is mainly linked to the acute and subacute phase , whereas Th1 response has been associated in addition with the chronic phase . IL-17 , IL-22 , TSLP , and IL-31 also play a role in AD means Atopic dermatitis . Transient receptor potential ( TRP means Transient receptor potential ) cation channels play a significant role in neuroinflammation , itch and pain , indicating neuroimmune circuits in AD means Atopic dermatitis . However , the Th2-driven cutaneous sensitization of TRP means Transient receptor potential channels is underappreciated . Emerging findings suggest that critical Th2-related cytokines cause potentiation of TRP means Transient receptor potential channels , thereby exaggerating inflammation and itch sensation . Evidence involves the following : ( i ) IL-13 enhances TRPV1 and TRPA1 transcription levels ; ( ii ) IL-31 sensitizes TRPV1 < i > via</i > transcriptional and channel modulation , and indirectly modulates TRPV3 in keratinocytes ; ( iii means indirectly modulates TRPV3 in keratinocytes; ) The Th2-cytokine TSLP increases TRPA1 synthesis in sensory neurons . These changes could be further enhanced by other Th2 means T helper-2 cytokines , including IL-4 , IL-25 , and IL-33 , which are inducers for IL-13 , IL-31 , or TSLP in skin . Taken together , this review highlights that Th2 means T helper-2 cytokines potentiate TRP means Transient receptor potential channels through diverse mechanisms under different inflammatory and pruritic conditions , and link this effect to distinct signaling cascades in AD means Atopic dermatitis . This review strengthens the notion that interrupting Th2-driven modulation of TRP means Transient receptor potential channels will inhibit transition from acute to chronic AD means Atopic dermatitis , thereby aiding the development of effective therapeutics and treatment optimization .\n",
        "Dupilumab , a monoclonal antibody against interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha that inhibits IL-4/IL-13 signalling is indicated in dermatology for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older and severe AD means atopic dermatitis in children 6 - 11 years , who are candidates for systemic therapy . Dupilumab received Early Access to Medicines Scheme ( EAMS means Early Access to Medicines Scheme ) approval for adults in March 2017 . The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy outcomes of treatment with dupilumab in EAMS means Early Access to Medicines Scheme . A retrospective analysis of adult patients enrolled in the dupilumab EAMS means Early Access to Medicines Scheme in the UK . Scores were assessed at baseline and follow up , including the Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index ) , Investigator 's Global Assessment Score ( IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment Score ) and Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index ) . Data were available for 57 adult patients treated with dupilumab for at least 12 weeks ; 73.6 % of patients had received prior treatment with 3 or 4 immunosuppressants . Baseline scores for the EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index and DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index were 27.93 ( standard deviation , SD 13.09 ) and 18.26 ( SD 6.18 ) respectively . AD means atopic dermatitis severity scores showed statistically significant improvement at week 16±4 weeks ( p & lt;0.001 for all ) . The mean change in EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index was 14.13 points with 66.7 % and 36.7 % achieving a 50 % ( EASI-50 ) and 75 % ( EASI-75 means EASI-50) and 75% ) improvement in EASI means Eczema Area and Severity Index , respectively at 16<sup>+/-</sup > 4 weeks . IGA means Investigator's Global Assessment Score scores improved by at least two categories for 75 % patients . DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index scores decreased by a mean of 9.0 points , with 80 % patients demonstrating a MCID 4-point improvement . For 85 % patients , clinicians rated the treatment response as being either ' better ' ( 19 % ) or ' much better ' ( 65 % ) . Dupilumab is associated with a significant and clinically relevant improvements in AD means atopic dermatitis as measured by patient- and physician-reported outcome measures . Importantly , the clinical efficacy , despite the refractory disease of this EAMS means Early Access to Medicines Scheme cohort , is comparable to that previously reported in clinical trials .\n",
        "There are few prospective observational studies on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) in children . We aimed to prospectively investigate the dynamics of change in the prevalence of AD means atopic dermatitis from early childhood to adolescence . We conducted a survey with a modified questionnaire to diagnose AD means atopic dermatitis based on The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire with 1230 13-year-old children who were born in the Minami ward , Yokohama City between May 2004 and June 2005 and had undergone physical examinations by dermatologists at 3 years of age . Among the 422 children who answered the questionnaire , 210 had undergone periodic physical examinations by dermatologists from 4 months to 3 years of age ( Cohort 1 ) , whereas 212 had undergone physical examinations only at 3 years of age ( Cohort 2 ) . The prevalence of AD means atopic dermatitis was 16.9 % in 422 children at 13 years of age , with 22.9 % , 16.6 % , 20.0 % and 18.3 % prevalence at 4 months , 18 months , 3 years and 13 years of age , respectively , in children who were followed up long-term . The frequency of AD means atopic dermatitis occurrence per year decreased after the age of 3 years ; a history of AD means atopic dermatitis at this age was significantly related to AD means atopic dermatitis at 13 years of age ( Fisher 's exact test , p&lt;0.001 ) . In conclusion , it was suggested that AD means atopic dermatitis in 3-year-old children is one of the risk factors for the development of AD means atopic dermatitis in 13-year-old children .\n",
        "Neurofibromatosis type 1 still lacks established treatment options aimed at controlling the progression of neurofibromas as well as effective therapy for the neurogenic itch associated with the disease . We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian woman with type 1 neurofibromatosis coexisting with severe refractory atopic dermatitis . Dupilumab , a novel anti-IL-4 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody , the first biologic agent approved for atopic dermatitis , was the drug of choice in this case . We observed remission of atopic dermatitis and a remarkable reduction in the size and swelling of neurofibromas and in the related pruritus , that became evident after one month of treatment . After 18 months of therapy , no new neurofibromas were detected and preexistent lesions showed no increase in size . These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dupilumab , a potent anti-inflammatory drug , may have a positive effect on type 1 neurofibromatosis by stopping the progression of preexisting neurofibromas and the onset of new lesions .\n",
        "Skin pain ( described as discomfort or soreness ) is increasingly recognized as a symptom of atopic dermatitis which impacts patient quality of life . This analysis examined the effect of baricitinib on skin pain in atopic dermatitis in three phase 3 studies ( BREEZE-AD1 , -AD2 , and -AD7 ) . Patients were randomly assigned 2:1:1:1 to receive once-daily placebo , baricitinib 1 mg , 2 mg , or 4 mg in BREEZE-AD1 ( N = 624 ) and -AD2 ( N = 615 ) and 1:1:1 to receive once-daily placebo , baricitinib 2 mg , or 4 mg , with topical corticosteroids , in BREEZE-AD7 ( N = 329 ) for 16 weeks . Patients recorded their skin pain severity using the Skin Pain Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS means Numerical Rating Scale ) via an electronic daily diary . Data were analyzed by study as least squares mean change from baseline in daily scores for the randomly assigned patients using mixed model repeated measures analysis . Analysis of Skin Pain NRS means Numerical Rating Scale response was done using logistic regression using non-responder imputation . Baricitinib produced significant percentage change from baseline compared with placebo in patient-reported skin pain severity by day 2 in BREEZE-AD1 ( baricitinib 4 mg - 11.9 % , p & lt ; 0.001 ; baricitinib 2 mg - 6.4 % , p = 0.016 ; baricitinib 1 mg - 6.2 % , p = 0.016 ) , -AD2 ( baricitinib 4 mg - 12.6 % , p & lt ; 0.001 ; baricitinib 2 mg - 5.6 % , p = 0.036 ; baricitinib 1 mg - 6.9 % , p = 0.011 ) , and -AD7 ( baricitinib 4 mg - 6.9 % , p = 0.04 ; baricitinib 2 mg - 7.9 % , p = 0.018 ) . A greater proportion of patients treated with baricitinib reported at least a 4-point reduction in Skin Pain NRS means Numerical Rating Scale score at week 16 ( Skin Pain NRS means Numerical Rating Scale responders ) in BREEZE-AD1 ( baricitinib 4 mg 25.3 % , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , -AD2 ( baricitinib 4 mg 20.0 % , p & lt ; 0.001 ; baricitinib 2 mg 19.0 % , p & lt ; 0.001 ) , and -AD7 ( baricitinib 4 mg 48.8 % , p & lt ; 0.001 ; baricitinib 2 mg 45.2 % , p = 0.004 ) compared to placebo . A significantly higher proportion of Skin Pain NRS means Numerical Rating Scale responders also achieved at least a 4-point improvement in Dermatology Life Quality Index at week 16 when compared with Skin Pain NRS means Numerical Rating Scale non-responders in BREEZE-AD1 ( 89.2 % , p & lt ; 0.0001 ) , -AD2 ( 92.5 % , p & lt ; 0.0001 ) , and -AD7 ( 88.3 % , p & lt ; 0.0001 ) .

        "Atopic dermatitis ( AD means Atopic dermatitis ) is a chronic , relapsing , inflammatory skin disease . Therapeutic patient education ( TPE means Therapeutic patient education ) has been demonstrated to be effective in AD means Atopic dermatitis in reducing disease severity and improving coping and quality of life . To describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with AD means Atopic dermatitis who had attended TPE means Therapeutic patient education sessions , as well as the characteristics of their parents , and compare them with those who did not attend TPE means Therapeutic patient education . Parents of children with AD means Atopic dermatitis aged 6 - 17 years old were recruited from a representative sample of the French population contacted by e-mail . Sociodemographic data and clinical information were collected in patients and parents . Clinical severity was assessed by parents using a proxy version of the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure ( POEM means Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure ) . Attendance to TPE means Therapeutic patient education sessions was assessed by the following question ' did your child or one or both parents attended TPE means Therapeutic patient education for AD means Atopic dermatitis ? ' . Also , the number of sessions was recorded . Determinants of TPE means Therapeutic patient education attendance were evaluated by univariable and multivariable analyses . Data were collected on 1063 parents and children with AD means Atopic dermatitis . A total of 131 ( 12.3 % ) children and/or parents attended TPE means Therapeutic patient education sessions . Most of them attended 2 - 5 TPE means Therapeutic patient education sessions . In that group , there were 85 boys ( 64.9 % ) , and severity evaluated by POEM means Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure was mild in 29.8 % , moderate in 52.7 % and severe in 17.6 % of patients . In the multivariable model , attending TPE means Therapeutic patient education sessions was significantly associated with sex of the child ( boy vs. girl ) , consultation with a dermatologist or a paediatrician , high clinical severity and presence of AD means Atopic dermatitis in parents . Despite recommendations , the use of TPE means Therapeutic patient education in children with AD means Atopic dermatitis is still low in France . There is a need for implementing such programmes in the management of the disease , in particular when the disease is severe .\n",
        "Common polygenic skin disorders , such as atopic dermatitis , may rarely present in a segmental or linear distribution due to cutaneous mosaicism . Only seven cases of superimposed linear atopic dermatitis have been reported to date .

        "Infancy and early childhood are crucial periods in the development of the human microbiome and shape the trajectory of microbial colonization , immune system development , and systemic disease . We review the development of the skin and gut microbiomes , their connection to the immune system , and their relevance to common pediatric pathologies . Beginning after birth , and likely even in utero , colonization of the skin and the gut occur in parallel , influenced by external factors . This colonization , in turn , dictates maturation of the immune system and contributes to conditions from atopic dermatitis to sepsis . Emerging literature is identifying links between the gut and skin microbiomes . The gut and skin microbiomes are associated with pediatric disease states . Immune and microbial plasticity make this unique period an ideal target for intervention . Investigating the purposeful manipulation of the pediatric microbiome may lead to novel treatment and prevention strategies .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disease that commonly affects patients . In addition to its effects on the skin , it has also been associated with other physical , psychosocial , and economic burdens along with numerous debilitating comorbidities . More recently , research has focused on the psychosocial and mental health aspect of atopic dermatitis , which has remained controversial . We reviewed the current literature and have discussed the association of atopic dermatitis with suicide , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder , and schizophrenia .\n",
        "Low epidermal filaggrin ( FLG means filaggrin ) is a risk factor for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and allergic comorbidity . FLG means filaggrin mutations do not fully explain the variation in epidermal FLG means filaggrin levels , highlighting that other genetic loci may also regulate FLG means filaggrin expression . We sought to identify genetic loci that regulate FLG means filaggrin expression and elucidate their functional and mechanistic consequences . A genome-wide association study of quantified skin FLG means filaggrin expression in lesional and baseline non(never)-lesional skin of children with AD means atopic dermatitis in the Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to Asthma in Children cohort was conducted . Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat approaches were used to create isogenic human keratinocytes differing only at the identified variant rs11652075 , and caspase recruitment domain family member 14 (CARD14)-deficient keratinocytes for subsequent mechanistic studies . The genome-wide association study identified the CARD14 rs11652075 variant to be associated with FLG means filaggrin expression in non(never)-lesional skin of children with AD means atopic dermatitis . Rs11652075 is a CARD14 expression quantitative trait locus in human skin and primary human keratinocytes . The T variant destroys a functional cytosine-phosphate-guanine site means sites , resulting in reduced cytosine-phosphate-guanine methylation at this site means sites ( but not neighboring sites ) in TT and CT compared with CC primary human keratinocytes and Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to Asthma in Children children 's skin samples , and rs11652075 increases CARD14 expression in an allele-specific fashion . Furthermore , studies in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-generated CC and TT isogenic keratinocytes , as well as CARD14-haplosufficient and deficient keratinocytes , reveal that IL-17A regulates FLG means filaggrin expression via CARD14 , and that the underlying mechanisms are dependent on the rs11652075 genotype . Our study identifies CARD14 as a novel regulator of FLG means filaggrin expression in the skin of children with AD means atopic dermatitis . Furthermore , CARD14 regulates skin FLG means filaggrin homeostasis in an rs11652075-dependent fashion .\n",
        "Dupilumab demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in two randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , phase III trials in adolescents ( 12 - 17 years ; LIBERTY AD means atopic dermatitis ADOL ) and children ( 6 - 11 years ; LIBERTY AD means atopic dermatitis PEDS ) with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) treated for 16 weeks . Here , we present the pharmacokinetic profiles and exposure-response ( E-R means exposure-response ) relationships of dupilumab that guided the posology in these populations . A total of 251 adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis were randomized to subcutaneous dupilumab monotherapy every 2 weeks ( q2w ; 200 mg q2w , baseline weight & lt ; 60 kg ; 300 mg q2w , ≥ 60 kg ) , dupilumab 300 mg every 4 weeks ( q4w ; non-weight tiered ) , or placebo ; 367 children with severe AD means atopic dermatitis were randomized to dupilumab q2w ( 100 mg q2w , baseline weight & lt ; 30 kg ; 200 mg q2w , ≥ 30 kg ) , dupilumab 300 mg q4w , or placebo . Children received concomitant topical corticosteroids in addition to dupilumab , and loading doses were administered at the start of therapy . Mean dupilumab trough concentrations at week 16 for weight subcategories in each dosing regimen were compared with adult exposures for the approved dupilumab 300 mg q2w regimen . Positive E-R means exposure-response relationships were demonstrated between dupilumab trough concentrations and AD means atopic dermatitis outcome measures across patient populations and regimens ; no relationship was observed with treatment-emergent conjunctivitis . Based on these analyses , a weight-tiered posology was proposed for adolescents ( 200/300 mg q2w in patients 30-&lt ; 60 kg/≥ 60 kg ) and children ( 300 mg q4w in patients 15-&lt ; 30 kg , 200 mg q2w in patients 30-&lt ; 60 kg ) with moderate-to-severe AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) experience burdensome symptoms and impaired quality of life ( QoL means quality of life ) . The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of topical AD means atopic dermatitis therapies on disease means defined as changeable or worsening control , physician and patient treatment satisfaction , and QoL means quality of life in a real-world setting . This was a retrospective , point-in-time study of physician-completed medical records and patient surveys drawn from two Adelphi AD means atopic dermatitis Disease Specific Programmes ™ ( 1 . adults ≥ 18 years old ; 2 . pediatrics ≤ 17 years old ) in the USA . Eligible physicians completed patient record forms and provided disease means defined as changeable or worsening control assessments . Physicians and matched patients were surveyed regarding their satisfaction with current treatment . Patient-reported outcomes included the Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index ) , Children 's DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index ( CDLQI means Children's DLQI ) , Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure ( POEM means Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure ) , and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment ( WPAI means Work Productivity and Activity Impairment ) questionnaire . A total of 394 adult ( topicals only , n = 284 ; topical plus systemic , n = 110 ) and 144 adolescent ( aged 12 - 17 years ; topicals only , n = 114 ; topical plus systemic , n = 30 ) patients who had received their current treatment for at least 1 month were included . Overall , 24.5 % of patients had physician-reported uncontrolled disease means defined as changeable or worsening ( adults , 22.8 % ; adolescents , 29.2 % ) . Rates of physician- and patient-reported dissatisfaction with current treatment were 32.0 % ( adults , 28.2 % ; adolescents , 42.4 % ) and 24.8 % ( adults , 24.0 % ; adolescents , 26.8 % ) , respectively , and were higher for patients with uncontrolled versus controlled disease means defined as changeable or worsening . Poorer disease means defined as changeable or worsening control and higher rates of treatment dissatisfaction were generally reported among patients receiving topical plus systemic therapy versus topicals alone . Patients with uncontrolled versus controlled disease means defined as changeable or worsening reported more impairment in the DLQI means Dermatology Life Quality Index , CDLQI means Children's DLQI , POEM means Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure , and WPAI means Work Productivity and Activity Impairment ( P & lt ; 0.05 for all ) , with generally greater impairments observed among patients on topical plus systemic therapy versus topicals alone . Patients receiving topical AD means atopic dermatitis therapies experienced uncontrolled disease means defined as changeable or worsening and reported decreased overall functioning and lower QoL. An unmet need for topical AD means atopic dermatitis treatments that improve disease means defined as changeable or worsening control and patient outcomes exists . Atopic dermatitis ( or eczema ) is a common skin condition that causes dry , cracked , and itchy skin . Patients are frequently prescribed topical therapy , such as ointments and creams , to apply directly to the affected skin . Additionally , patients may be prescribed systemic therapies , which are oral or injectable medications that work throughout the entire body . This study included 394 adults and 144 adolescents ( aged 12–17 years ) with atopic dermatitis . All patients in the study were receiving topical therapy , and some received both topical and systemic therapy . The goal of the study was to evaluate how satisfied patients and their doctors were with current treatment and to learn how patients in the study felt about their quality of life . Patients and their doctors completed surveys that asked about feelings , symptoms , and whether their condition affects their work . The study results showed that patients had high levels of dissatisfaction with their treatment . Doctors reported that between one-fifth and one-quarter of adult patients and up to one-half of adolescent patients had uncontrolled disease means defined as changeable or worsening ( defined as changeable or worsening ) . Patients with uncontrolled disease means defined as changeable or worsening reported higher dissatisfaction with their therapy and a negative outlook on their quality of life versus those with controlled disease means defined as changeable or worsening ( defined as stable or improving by their doctors ) . In summary , doctors and their patients currently using topical medications to treat atopic dermatitis reported that treatments were not working well enough and that uncontrolled disease means defined as changeable or worsening was negatively affecting patients ’ quality of life and work , indicating that additional treatment options are needed .\n",

        "Prenatal exposure to heavy metals may cause atopic diseases . Little association between cord blood total immunoglobulin E ( CB-tIgE means cord blood total immunoglobulin E ) levels and the occurrence of atopic diseases has been found . This study investigated the atopic status and tIgE trajectory trend in a Taiwanese birth cohort over 15 years . We also assessed the effect of maternal heavy metal exposure on maternal serum cytokine and CB-tIgE means cord blood total immunoglobulin E levels . We recruited 430 pregnant women during their third trimester in 2000 - 2001 . Maternal urinary heavy metal concentrations and serum cytokine levels were measured . The CB-tIgE means cord blood total immunoglobulin E and serum tIgE levels of the women 's children when they were aged 5 , 8 , 11 , and 14 years were measured . The upper quartile of the maternal urinary arsenic concentration was associated with an increased risk of a CB-tIgE means cord blood total immunoglobulin E level higher than 1 IU/mL ( odds ratio , 1.845 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.003 - 3.395 ) . Serum tIgE trajectory levels were the highest in children with asthma , followed by those with atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis at the age of 5 - 14 years . Serum tIgE levels tended to peak at the age of 11 years in the atopic children but were stable from the age of 8 years in the non-atopic children . We first demonstrated that serum tIgE levels reached a trajectory peak in the atopic children aged 11 years . Prenatal exposure to arsenic may increase the risk of elevated CB-tIgE means cord blood total immunoglobulin E levels . Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the mechanism through which maternal serum cytokines affect the occurrence of atopic diseases in children .\n",
        "Contact dermatitis ( CD means Contact dermatitis ) is a common inflammatory skin disease caused by exposure to contact allergens and irritants . It is also the most common reason of occupational dermatitis and contributes greatly to hand dermatitis and facial dermatitis . Besides the two major forms of contact dermatitis : allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis , other subtypes of CD means Contact dermatitis have been recognized including immediate skin reactions , photoinduced contact dermatitis , systemic contact dermatitis , and non-eczematous contact dermatitis . CD means Contact dermatitis is a great imitator which can mimic many kinds of skin diseases , such as atopic dermatitis , lichen planus , and angioedema . For the diagnosis of CD means Contact dermatitis , a complete medical history , including occupational history , is very important . It can give a clue of CD means Contact dermatitis and provide a list of suspected substances . Besides the well-known diagnostic test , patch testing , there are many other diagnostic tests can be used to help diagnosis of CD means Contact dermatitis and identify the causative allergens , including photopatch test , skin tests for detecting of immediate contact reactions , serum allergen-specific IgE test , and qualitative and quantitative testing of allergen in the suspected materials patients exposed to and challenge test . Before the treatment , the suspected irritants or allergens should be avoided completely . This includes both the removal of the patient from the environment that contains those substances and the promotion of the metabolism and expulsion of the allergens that have been absorbed by the body . In addition , it is also important to restore the skin barrier and reduce skin inflammation through multiple treatments , such as emollients , topical corticosteroids , and antihistamines , as well as systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants . Early and appropriate treatments are important to prevent further deterioration and persistence of the skin condition .\n",
        "The expanding number of potential treatment options for atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) highlights the need to better understand the treatment preferences of individuals with AD means atopic dermatitis . This study identified attributes that most greatly influenced treatment preferences of adults/adolescents/caregivers of children with mild/moderate/severe AD means atopic dermatitis . Adults ( ≥18 years ) , adolescents ( 12 - 17 years ) , and caregivers of children ( 2 - 11 years ) with mild , moderate , or severe AD means atopic dermatitis in the United States ( US means United States ) and United Kingdom ( UK means United Kingdom ) participated in semistructured interviews . Thematic analysis was used to identify and generate themes across the interview results describing the treatment attributes of greatest importance to participants . Qualitative interviews were conducted with 35 adults , 35 caregivers , and 33 adolescent participants across both countries ( n = 103 ; US means United States = 51 ; UK means United Kingdom = 52 ) and all severity groups ( mild = 43 ; moderate = 47 ; severe = 13 ) . The most important treatment attributes included efficacy ( 96.1 % ; speed and duration of symptom relief ) , mode of administration ( 66.0 % ; route of administration , frequency , and convenience ) , and side effects ( 55.3 % , short-term , long-term , and general ) . Efficacy , mode of administration , and side effects were the most important attributes that influenced AD means atopic dermatitis treatment preferences for patients and caregivers across different countries , ages , and disease severity . These results may assist patients/caregivers/clinicians in shared decision-making discussions to improve treatment adherence and outcomes .\n",
        "Most atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) patients are managed by primary care providers ( PCPs means primary care providers ) .

        "Skin barrier functions develop after birth and may be related to skin disorders in infants . We aimed to assess associations between dynamic trends of four skin barrier functional parameters in early life with infant atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) . Based on the prospective cohort MKNFOAD ( NCT02889081 ) , we examined transepidermal water loss ( TEWL means transepidermal water loss ) , stratum corneum hydration ( SCH means stratum corneum hydration ) , skin pH , and sebum content at five anatomical sites ( cheek , forehead , forearm , abdomen , and lower leg ) in 418 term infants at birth , 42 days , and 6 months . Trend differences by sex and association with AD means atopic dermatitis at age 1 year were tested using variance analyses . Associations of the parameters with AD means atopic dermatitis risk were tested using discrete time survival analysis , adjusting extensive covariates including parental history of allergy , infant 's sex , birth weight ( kg ) , and delivery mode . Odds ratios ( ORs means Odds ratios ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) were reported . Overall TEWL means transepidermal water loss and SCH means stratum corneum hydration appeared trends of increase while skin surface pH and sebum content showed trends of decrease within the first six postnatal months . Sex differences were significant for sebum content only ( < i > p</i > & lt ; 0.001 ) . After adjustment for parental and children covariates , cheek TEWL means transepidermal water loss at birth ( OR = 1.26 , 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.57 , < i > p</i > = 0.045 ) and 42 days ( OR = 1.52 , 95 % CI 1.17 - 1.97 , < i > p</i > = 0.002 ) were significantly associated with increased AD means atopic dermatitis risk . Associations were not observed between SCH means stratum corneum hydration , skin pH , and sebum content at birth or 42 days with AD means atopic dermatitis . Skin barrier functions of Chinese term infants varied nonlinearly after birth . Higher postnatal TEWL means transepidermal water loss levels in early life indicate higher risk of early-onset AD means atopic dermatitis .\n",
        "Cold atmospheric plasma generates free radicals through the ionization of air at room temperature . Its effect and safety profile as a treatment modality for atopic dermatitis lesions have not been evaluated prospectively enough . We aimed to investigate the effect and safety of cold atmospheric plasma in patients with atopic dermatitis with a prospective pilot study . Cold atmospheric plasma treatment or sham control treatment were applied respectively in randomly assigned and symmetric skin lesions . Three treatment sessions were performed at weeks 0 , 1 , and 2 . Clinical severity indices were assessed at weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , and 4 after treatment . Additionally , the microbial characteristics of the lesions before and after treatments were analyzed . We included 22 patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis presented with symmetric lesions . We found that cold atmospheric plasma can alleviate the clinical severity of atopic dermatitis . Modified atopic dermatitis antecubital severity and eczema area and severity index score were significantly decreased in the treated group . Furthermore , scoring of atopic dermatitis score and pruritic visual analog scales significantly improved . Microbiome analysis revealed significantly reduced proportion of Staphylococcus aureus in the treated group . Cold atmospheric plasma can significantly improve mild and moderate atopic dermatitis without safety issues .\n",
        "Objectives Despite suggested associations among smoking exposures and the prevalence of allergic diseases in children , studies examining the effect of prenatal maternal smoking and secondhand smoking on the occurrence of these diseases in children are limited . Our study aimed to investigate the association between prenatal maternal smoking as well as secondhand smoking and the incidence of asthma or atopic dermatitis in children . Methods We included checkup data of a total of 53,505 children living in Kobe , Japan , without missing values for exposure or outcome , between April 1 , 2004 , and March 31 , 2013 . The exposure variables were prenatal maternal smoking , prenatal secondhand smoking , and postnatal secondhand smoking till 4 months , which were assessed by maternal notification form and exclusively classified into eight categories . The outcome variables were the incidence of asthma or atopic dermatitis in the respective children up to 3 years of age assessed by a checkup questionnaire . The association between the smoking exposures and the development of asthma or atopic dermatitis up to 3 years was examined using a generalized linear mixed model with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI means confidence intervals ) . Additionally , multiple imputation methods were used for the missing covariates . Results Of the 53,505 children , 27,210 ( 50.9 % ) were males and 26,218 ( 49.0 % ) were females . In total , 5,810 ( 10.9 % ) children were diagnosed with asthma and 4,964 ( 9.3 % ) with atopic dermatitis up to 3 years of their age . Compared to the children born to nonsmoking mothers during pregnancy and those without exposure to postnatal secondhand smoking , the adjusted odds ratio for the incidence of asthma up to 3 years of their age was found to be 2.04 ( 95 % CI means confidence intervals : 1.38 - 3.01 ) in children exposed to prenatal maternal smoking . Similarly , the adjusted odds ratio for the incidence of asthma in children exposed to maternal secondhand smoking during pregnancy was 1.12 ( 95 % CI means confidence intervals : 1.01 - 1.25 ) when compared with children who were never exposed to any smoking . Additionally , the adjusted odds ratio increased to 1.86 ( 95 % CI means confidence intervals : 1.42 - 2.44 ) in children exposed to both prenatal maternal smoking and secondhand smoking . In contrast , no statistical significance was observed among the smoking exposures and the incidence of atopic dermatitis in the children . Conclusions Our study confirmed that prenatal maternal and secondhand smoking were associated with the incidence of asthma in children . These findings suggest a need to focus on smoking cessation by pregnant women as well as by family members living together to prevent the development of asthma in children .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with pruritus . Skin affected by atopic dermatitis not only shows a high percentage of Staphylococcus aureus colonization , but corneal barrier dysfunction is also known to occur . It is considered a risk factor for bacterial infections in various areas of the body . However , the relationship between atopic dermatitis and bacterial infection following neurological surgery has not yet been reported . Here , we present a case of atopic dermatitis in which the surgical site became infected twice and finally resolved only after the atopic dermatitis was treated . A 50-year-old Japanese woman with atopic dermatitis underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping to prevent impending rupture . Postoperatively , she developed repeated epidural empyema following titanium cranioplasty . As a result of atopic dermatitis treatment with oral antiallergy medicines and external heparinoids , postoperative infection was suppressed by using an absorbable plastic plate for cranioplasty . The patient 's postoperative course was uneventful for 16 months . Atopic dermatitis is likely to cause surgical-site infection in neurosurgical procedures , and the use of a metal implant could promote the development of surgical-site infection in patients with dermatitis .\n",
        "Eczema is usually the first allergic manifestation to appear in life attributed to gene-environment interactions . IL13 , IL4 , MS4A2 and ILR4A are four key inflammatory genes associated with atopy . This study aimed to explore gene-environment interactions on eczema in early life among the above four genes and environmental factors in Chinese Han children . Five hundred ninety-seven children from a birth cohort who completed two-year follow-up were enrolled and their cord blood was collected . Subjects were genotyped for six polymorphisms in the aforementioned four genes . The children were followed at 6 , 12 and 24 months , with epidemiologic information and medical history of eczema collected by questionnaire and eczema assessed by dermatologists . Among the 597 children , 168 were diagnosed with eczema and the others were not after 2 years of follow-up . MS4A2 rs569108 GG genotype ( P = 1.68E-02 , odds ratio ( OR means odds ratio ) = 4.66 ) and antibiotic use ( P = 3.75E-4 , OR means odds ratio = 2.02 ) were found independently associated with development of childhood eczema . Children with both antibiotic use and MS4A2 rs569108 GG genotype were more likely to develop eczema than those with only antibiotic use or GG homozygote ( OR means odds ratio = 6.24 VS . 2.04 or 4.68 ) . MS4A2 rs569108 polymorphism and antibiotic use were solely associated with eczema , and they interacted with each other to increase the risk of developing the disease in Chinese Han toddlers . Long-term follow-up along with functional and replication studies are still needed .\n",
        "Type 2 immunity , illustrated by < i > T</i > helper 2 lymphocytes ( Th2 means T</i> helper 2 lymphocytes ) and downstream cytokines ( IL-4 , IL-13 , IL-31 ) as well as group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2 ) , is important in host defense and wound healing.<sup>1</sup > The hallmark of type 2 inflammation is eosinophilia and/or high IgE counts and is best recognized in atopic diathesis . Persistent eosinophilia , such as seen in hypereosinophilic syndromes , leads to fibrosis and hence therapeutic Type 2 inhibition in fibrotic diseases is of high interest . Furthermore , as demonstrated in cutaneous < i > T</i > cell lymphoma , advanced disease is characterized by Th1 to Th2 means T</i> helper 2 lymphocytes switch allowing cancer progression and immunosuppression . Development of targeted monoclonal antibodies against IL-4Rα ( eg , dupilumab ) led to a paradigm shift for the treatment of atopic dermatitis ( AD means atopic dermatitis ) and stimulated research to better understand the role of Type 2 inflammation in other skin conditions . In this review , we summarize up to date knowledge on the role of Type 2 inflammation in skin diseases other than AD means atopic dermatitis and highlight whether the use of Type 2 targeted therapies has been documented or is being investigated in clinical trials . This manuscript reviews the role of Type 2 inflammation in dermatitis , neurodermatitis , IgE-mediated dermatoses ( eg , bullous pemphigoid , chronic spontaneous urticaria ) , sclerodermoid conditions and skin neoplasms .\n",

        "If your skin itches and turns red from time to time , you might have eczema . This skin condition is very common in children , but adults can get it too . Eczema is sometimes called atopic dermatitis , which is the most common form . “ Atopic ” refers to an allergy . People with eczema often have allergies or asthma along with itchy , red skin . Eczema comes in a few other forms , too . Each eczema type has its own set of symptoms and triggers . There are also some common symptoms for all types of eczema : dry , scaly skin , redness , itching , which may be intense .\n",
        "Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema . It usually starts in childhood , and often gets milder or goes away by adulthood . Atopic dermatitis is part of what doctors call the atopic triad . “ Triad ” means three . The other two diseases in the triad are asthma and hay fever . Many people with atopic dermatitis have all three conditions . Symptoms : the rash often forms in the creases of your elbows or knees skin in areas where the rash appears may turn lighter or darker , or get thicker small bumps may appear and leak fluid if you scratch them babies often get the rash on their scalp and cheeks your skin can get infected if you scratch it . Causes : Atopic dermatitis happens when your skin ’s natural barrier against the elements is weakened . This means your skin is less able to protect you against irritants and allergens . Atopic dermatitis is likely caused by a combination of factors such as : genes , dry skin , an immune system problem , triggers in the environment .\n",
        "Contact dermatitis : If you have red , irritated skin that ’s caused by a reaction to substances you touch , you may have contact dermatitis . It comes in two types : Allergic contact dermatitisis an immune system reaction to an irritant like latex or metal . Irritant contact dermatitisstarts when a chemical or other substance irritates your skin . Symptoms : your skin itches , turns red , burns , and stings itchy bumps called hives may pop up on your skin fluid-filled blisters can form that may ooze and crust over over time , the skin may thicken and feel scaly or leathery . Causes : Contact dermatitis happens when you touch a substance that irritates your skin or causes an allergic reaction . The most common causes are : detergents , bleach , jewelry , latex , nickel , paint , poison ivy and other poisonous plants , skin care products , including makeup , soaps and perfumes , solvents , tobacco smoke .\n",
        "Dyshidrotic eczema causes small blisters to form on your hands and feet . It ’s more common in women than men . Symptoms : fluid-filled blisters form on your fingers , toes , palms , and soles of your feet , these blisters may itch or hurt , the skin can scale , crack , and flake . Causes : allergies , damp hands and feet , exposure to substances such as nickel , cobalt , or chromium salt , stress .\n",
        "Hand eczema : Eczema that only affects your hands is called hand eczema . You may get this type if you work in a job like hairdressing or cleaning , where you regularly use chemicals that irritate the skin . Symptoms : your hands get red , itchy , and dry , they may form cracks or blisters . Causes : Hand eczemais triggered by exposure to chemicals . People who work in jobs that expose them to irritants are more likely to get this form , such as : cleaning , airdressing , healthcare , laundry or dry cleaning .\n",
        "Neurodermatitis : Neurodermatitis is similar to atopic dermatitis . It causes thick , scaly patches to pop up on your skin . Symptoms : thick , scaly patches form on your arms , legs , back of your neck , scalp , bottoms of your feet , backs of your hands , or genitals , these patches can be very itchy , especially when you ’re relaxed or asleep if you scratch the patches , they can bleed and get infected . Causes : Neurodermatitis usually starts in people who have other types of eczema or psoriasis . Doctors do n’t know exactly what causes it , although stress can be a trigger .\n",
